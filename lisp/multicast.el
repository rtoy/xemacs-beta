;;; Commentary:

;; This file just contains a lisp frontend to the internal function
;; open-multicast-group-internal written in C and belonging to process.c
;; Well, nothing much to say about it ... read the doc string.


;;; Change Log:

;; Rev. of Mon Jan 19 19:04:44 1998 : packaging cleanup
;; Rev. of Thu Dec 11 13:54:26 1997 : updated the docstring
;; Rev. of Mon Dec  8 15:28:47 1997 : Improved the doc string
;; Rev. of Thu Dec  4 16:38:09 1997 : Initial Version.


;;; Code:

(defun open-multicast-group (name buffer address)
  "Open a multicast connection on the specified address.
Returns a process object to represent the connection.
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.
NAME is a name for the process. It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at the end of that buffer, unless you specify an output
 stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated with any
 buffer.
ADDRESS specifies a standard multicast address \"dest/port/ttl\":
 dest is an internet address between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255
 port is a communication port like in traditional unicast
 ttl is the time-to-live (15 for site, 63 for region and 127 for world).

WARNING: it is *strongly* recommended to avoid using groups beginning with
         224 or 239. Such groups are considered 'admin' groups, and may
         behave in a surprising way ...

The read/write coding systems used for process I/O on the process are
determined as follows:

1. `coding-system-for-read', `coding-system-for-write', if non-nil.
      (Intended as a temporary overriding mechanism for use by Lisp
      code.)
2. The matching value for the port from `network-coding-system-alist',
      if any, and if non-nil.  The value may be either a single coding
      system, used for both read and write; or a cons of read/write; or a
      function, called to get one of the other two values.
3. The value of `default-network-coding-system', which should be a cons
      of read/write coding systems, if the values are non-nil.
4. The coding system `undecided' for read, and `raw-text' for write.

Note that the processes of determining the read and write coding systems
proceed essentially independently one from the other, as in `start-process'.

You can change the coding systems later on using
`set-process-coding-system', `set-process-input-coding-system', or
`set-process-output-coding-system'."
