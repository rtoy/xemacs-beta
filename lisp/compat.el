;;; Commentary:

;; The idea is to provide emulation of API's in a namespace-clean way.  Lots of packages are filled with declarations such as

;; (defalias 'gnus-overlay-get 'extent-property)

; There should be a single package to provide such compatibility code.  The
; tricky part is how to do it in a clean way, without packages interfering
; with each other.

; The basic usage of compat is:

; (1) Each package copies compat.el and renames it, e.g. gnus-compat.el.

; (2) `compat' defines various API's that can be activated.  To use them in a
;     file, first place code like this at the top of the file:

;(let ((compat-current-package 'Gnus))
;  (require 'gnus-compat))

; then wrap the rest of the code like this:

; (Gnus-compat-wrap '(overlays events)

;;; Commentary

;; blah

;;; Code

;(defun random-module-my-fun (bar baz)
;  ...
;  (overlay-put overlay 'face 'bold)
;  ...
;)
;
;(defun ...
;)
;
;
;
;
;) ;; end of (Gnus-compat)

;;;; random-module.el ends here

; (3) What this does is implement the requested API's (in this case, the
;     overlay API from GNU Emacs and event API from XEmacs) in whichever
;     version of Emacs is running, with names such as
;     `Gnus-compat-overlay-put', and then it uses `macrolet' to map the
;     generic names in the wrapped code into namespace-clean names.  The
;     result of loading `gnus-compat' leaves around only functions beginning
;     with `Gnus-compat' (or whatever prefix was specified in
;     `compat-current-package').  This way, various packages, with various
;     versions of `compat' as part of them, can coexist, with each package
;     running the version of `compat' that it's been tested with.  The use of
;     `macrolet' ensures that only code that's lexically wrapped -- not code
;     that's called from that code -- is affected by the API mapping.

;; Typical usage:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; 1. Wrap modules that define compatibility functions like this:     ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;...

;;;; overlay.el ends here

  "Make use of compatibility functions and macros in GROUPS.
GROUPS is a symbol, an API group, or list of API groups.  Each API group
defines a set of functions, macros, variables, etc. and that will (or
should ideally) work on all recent versions of both GNU Emacs and XEmacs,
and (to some extent, depending on how the functions were designed) on older
version.  When this function is used, it will generally not be named
`compat-wrap', but have some name such as `Gnus-compat-wrap', if this is
wrapping something in `gnus'. (The renaming happened when the `compat'
package was loaded -- see discussion at top).

To use `compat' in your package (assume your package is `gnus'), you first
have to do a bit if setup.

-- Copy and rename compat.el, e.g. to `gnus-compat.el'.  The name must be
   globally unique across everything on the load path (that means all
   packages).
-- Incude this file in your package.  It will not interfere with any other
   versions of compat (earlier, later, etc.) provided in other packages
   and similarly renamed.

To make use of the API's provided:

-- First place code like this at the top of the file, after the copyright
   notices and comments:

\(let ((compat-current-package 'Gnus))
  (require 'gnus-compat))

-- then wrap the rest of the code like this, assuming you want access to
   the GNU Emacs overlays API, and the XEmacs events API:

\(Gnus-compat-wrap '(overlays xem-events)

...
...
...

\(defun gnus-random-fun (overlay baz)
  ...
  (overlay-put overlay 'face 'bold)
  ...
)

...
...

\(defun gnus-random-fun-2 (event)
  (interactive "e")
  (let ((x (event-x event))
	(y (event-y event)))
    ...
    )
  )

) ;; end of (Gnus-compat)

;;;; random-module.el ends here

Both the requested API's will be implemented whichever version of Emacs
\(GNU Emacs, XEmacs, etc.) is running, and (with limitations) on older
versions as well.  Furthermore, the API's are provided *ONLY* to code
that's actually, lexically wrapped by `compat-wrap' (or its renamed
version).  All other code, including code that's called by the wrapped
code, is not affected -- e.g. if we're on XEmacs, and `overlay-put' isn't
normally defined, then it won't be defined in code other than the wrapped
code, even if the wrapped code calls that code.  Clever, huh?

What happens is that the `compat-wrap' actually uses `macrolet' to
inline-substitute calls to `overlay-put' to (in this case)
`Gnus-compat-overlay-put', which was defined when `gnus-compat' was loaded.

What happens is that is implement the requested API's (in this case, the
overlay API from GNU Emacs and event API from XEmacs) in whichever
version of Emacs is running, with names such as
`Gnus-compat-overlay-put', and then it uses `macrolet' to map the
generic names in the wrapped code into namespace-clean names.  The
result of loading `gnus-compat' leaves around only functions beginning
with `Gnus-compat' (or whatever prefix was specified in
`compat-current-package').  This way, various packages, with various
versions of `compat' as part of them, can coexist, with each package
running the version of `compat' that it's been tested with.  The use of
`macrolet' ensures that only code that's lexically wrapped -- not code
that's called from that code -- is affected by the API mapping.

Before using `compat' 

For any file where you want to make use of one or more API's provided by
`compat', first do this:

Wrap a call to `compat-wrap' around your entire file, like this:

;; First, you copied compat.el into your package -- we're assuming \"gnus\" --
;; and renamed it, e.g. gnus-compat.el.  Now we load it and tell it to
;; use `Gnus' as the prefix for all stuff it defines. (Use a capital letter
;; or some similar convention so that these names are not so easy to see.)

\(let ((current-compat-package 'Gnus))
  (require 'gnus-compat))

;; The function `compat-wrap' was mapped to `Gnus-compat-wrap'.  The idea
;; is that the raw functions beginning with `compat-' are never actually
;; defined.  They may appear as function calls inside of functions, but
;; they will always be mapped to something beginning with the given prefix.

\(Gnus-compat-wrap '(overlays xem-events)

 ...

)

You should simply wrap this around the code that uses the functions
and macros in GROUPS.  Typically, a call to `compat' should be placed
at the top of an ELisp module, with the closing parenthesis at the
bottom; use this in place of a `require' statement.  Wrapped code can
be either function or macro definitions or other ELisp code, and
wrapped function or macro definitions need not be at top level.  All
calls to the compatibility functions or macros will be noticed anywhere
within the wrapped code.  Calls to `fboundp' within the wrapped code
will also behave correctly when called on compatibility functions and
macros, even though they would return nil elsewhere (including in code
in other modules called dynamically from the wrapped code).

The functions and macros define in GROUP are actually defined under
prefixed names, to avoid namespace clashes and bad interactions with
other code that calls `fboundp'.  All calls inside of the wrapped code
to the compatibility functions and macros in GROUP are lexically
mapped to the prefixed names.  Since this is a lexical mapping, code
in other modules that is called by functions in this module will not
be affected."
