;;; Commentary:

;; Author: Ben wing, 2001?

;; Placed in a separate file so it can be loaded after the various
;; coding systems have been created, because we'll be using them at
;; load time.

;; #### Issues (this discussion probably belongs elsewhere)
;; 1.  "Big" characters are unrepresentable.  Should give error, warning,
;;     not just substitute "~".
;; 2.  21.4 compatibility?
;; 3.  make-char: non-mule barfs on non-iso8859-1.

VAR can be one of:

`bfcs-for-read'

  Lisp variable of the same name; the default coding system used when
  reading in a file, in the absence of more specific settings. (See
  `insert-file-contents' for a description of exactly how a file's
  coding system is determined when it's read in.)

`default-bfcs'

  Default value of `buffer-file-coding-system', the buffer-local
  variable specifying a file's coding system to be used when it is
  written out.  Set using `set-default-buffer-file-coding-system' (or
  the primitive `setq-default').  When a file is read in,
  `buffer-file-coding-system' for that file is set from the coding
  system used to read the file in; the default value applies to newly
  created files.

`native'

  The coding system named `native'.  Changed using
  `define-coding-system-alias'.  Used internally when passing
  text to or from system API's, unless the particular
  API specifies another coding system.

`keyboard'

 #### fill in

`terminal'

 #### fill in

`process-read'

 #### fill in

`process-write'

 #### fill in

`no-conv-cs'

  Coding system used when category `no-conversion' is detected.


CONFIG is one of: (abbreviations in parens)

`no-mule-no-eol-detection' (NoMule)

Non-Windows, no Mule support, no automatic EOL detection. (Controlled by
`eol-detection-enabled-p', which is set by the command-line flag
-enable-eol-detection or the configure flag --with-default-eol-detection.)

`unix-no-mule-eol-detection' (NoMuleEOL)

Non-Windows, no Mule support, automatic EOL detection.

`unix-mule' (Mule)

Non-Windows, Mule support.

`windows-no-mule' (MSW)

MS Windows or old Cygwin, no Mule support.

`windows-mule' (MSWMule)

MS Windows or old Cygwin, Mule support.

`cygwin-utf-8' (CygUTF)

Cygwin 1.7 or later, which uses UTF-8 consistently.

The following coding system abbreviations are also used in the table:

MSW-MB = mswindows-multibyte
MSW-MB = mswindows-multibyte-system-default
