;;; Commentary:

;; If you are wanting to add files to be dumped into your local version of
;; XEmacs, DO NOT add them here.  Use site-init.el or site-load.el instead.

;; ***Note the docstrings for the variables in this file. They follow the
;; conventions described in lib-src/make-docfile.c, and any new variables or
;; functions added to this file should follow those conventions too, since
;; this file is always loaded uncompiled, and the byte-compiler never gets a
;; chance to format the docstrings in the way make-docfile.c understands.

;; This is loaded into a bare XEmacs to make a dumpable one.

;;; Code:

;; Help debug problems.
