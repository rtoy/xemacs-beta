;;; Directories and paths

;;; Terminology:

;;; A *package hierarchy* is a directory that contains a collection of
;;; packages; it has lisp/, info/, etc/ etc. subdirectories that
;;; contain the files constituting the packages.

;;; A *package directory* contains package hierarchies---the package
;;; hierarchies are typically in directories "xemacs-packages",
;;; "mule-packages", and so on.  A package hierarchy might only be
;;; applicable for specific variants of XEmacs.

;;; Package hierarchies come in "early", "late", and "last" variants,
;;; depending on their relative location in the various paths.
;;; "Early" hierarchies are typically in the user's home directory,
;;; "late" hierarchies are typically part of the XEmacs installation,
;;; and "last" package hierarchies are for special purposes, such as
;;; making the packages of some previous XEmacs version available.
