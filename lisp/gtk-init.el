This allows the user to set initial geometry without using GNOME and session

window flicker on resizing.

It is normally not useful to change without recompiling XEmacs.")

  "An assoc list of command line args that should be in gtk-initial-argv-list.
This is necessary because GTK and GNOME consider it a fatal error if they
receive unknown command line arguments (perfectly reasonable).  But this
means that if the user specifies a file name on the command line they will
be unable to start.  So we filter the command line and allow only items in
this list in.

The CDR of the assoc list is whether it accepts an argument.  For the
moment, all options are in GNU long form.")
