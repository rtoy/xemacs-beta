;; mapping between XEmacs charsets and code pages.  something like this
;; will might around once all the Unicode code is written, so we know how
;; to choose the right font.  (perhaps "code pages" will become "Unicode
;; subranges"; they're more or less equivalent under Windows from a font
;; perspective.) But ...  in reality, we can just query the charset for its
;; Unicode ranges, and the "charset ID" is not a good indicator of what a
;; particular font supports; e.g. there's no charset ID at all for Indian
;; fonts, but Windows clearly supports them. (The docs say that Indian
;; support is "all Unicode"; i.e. charset ID's are on their way out.  I
;; guess we're supposed to query the font for what ranges it supports, and
;; what its preferred range is.)
