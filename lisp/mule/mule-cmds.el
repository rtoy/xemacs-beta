  documentation      VALUE is documentation of what this language environment
                     is meant for, and how to use it.

  charset            VALUE is a list of the character sets used by this
                     language environment.

  sample-text        VALUE is one line of text,
                     written using those character sets,
                     appropriate for this language environment.

  setup-function     VALUE is a function to call to switch to this
                     language environment.

  exit-function      VALUE is a function to call to leave this
                     language environment.

  coding-system      VALUE is a list of coding systems that are good
                     for saving text written in this language environment.
                     This list serves as suggestions to the user;
                     in effect, as a kind of documentation.

  coding-priority    VALUE is a list of coding systems for this language
                     environment, in order of decreasing priority.
                     This is used to set up the coding system priority
                     list when you switch to this language environment.

  input-method       VALUE is a default input method for this language
                     environment.

  features           VALUE is a list of features requested in this
                     language environment.

  tutorial           VALUE is a tutorial file name written in the language.

  locale             VALUE is a list of locale expressions, which serve
                     two purposes: (1) Determining the language
                     environment from the current system locale at
                     startup, and (2) determining how to set the system
                     locale when the language environment is changed.
                     Each expression will be tried in turn, and should
                     be a string (for case (1), the string is matched
                     against the current locale using the regular
                     expression \"^STRING[^A-Za-z0-9]\"; for case (2),
                     the string is passed directly to
                     `set-current-locale' until a non-nil result is
                     returned), or a function of one argument.  For
                     case (1), this argument will be a locale, and the
                     function should return t or nil to indicate
                     whether this locale matches the language
                     environment; for case (2), the argument will be
                     nil, and the function should call
                     `set-current-locale' itself and return the set
                     locale string if the locale was successfully set,
                     and nil otherwise.

                     NOTE: This property is *NOT* used under MS Windows;
                     instead, the `mswindows-locale' property is used.

  cygwin-locale      VALUE specifies a general Unix-style C library
                     locale that will be used to initialize the LANG
                     environment variable under MS Windows native, when the
                     system cannot test out the locales specified in the
                     `locale' property.  This is so that Cygwin programs
                     can be run from an MS Windows native XEmacs.  If not
                     specified, the last entry in `locale' will be used.

  native-coding-system   VALUE is a single coding-system expression, or a
                     list of such expressions.  These expressions are
                     used to compute the operating system's native
                     coding system, i.e. the coding system to be used
                     as the alias for `native' and `file-name'.  This
                     specifies the coding system used for text
                     exchanged with the operating system, such as file
                     names, environment variables, subprocess
                     arguments, etc.  Each expression should be either
                     a symbol naming a coding system or a function
                     (anything that is `functionp') of one argument,
                     which is passed the current locale corresponding
                     to this language environment and should return a
                     coding system or nil.  Each expression is tried in
                     turn until a coding system is obtained.  If there
                     is no non-nil result, or no value is specified for
                     this property, the first coding system listed
                     under the `coding-system' property is used.

                     NOTE: This is *NOT* used under MS Windows.
                     Instead, `mswindows-multibyte-system-default'
                     is always used, since the system default code
                     page is what the Win32 API routines make use
                     of, and this cannot be changed. (We get around
                     this by using the Unicode versions whenever
                     possible -- i.e. on Windows NT/2000, and on
                     Windows 9x with the few API's that support
                     Unicode.)

  mswindows-locale   VALUE is an element of the form MSWINDOWS-LOCALE, or
                     a list of such elements.  Each element is an MS
                     Windows locale, of the form that can be passed to
                     `mswindows-set-current-locale'.  This property is used
                     both to determine the current language environment at
                     startup (by matching MSWINDOWS-LOCALE against the
                     value returned by `mswindows-user-default-locale') and
                     to set the values of `set-current-locale' and
                     `mswindows-set-current-locale' when the current
                     language environment is changed. (The correct CLIB
                     locale can always be generated by passing in the
                     SUBLANG, with dashes in place of underscores, or the
                     LANG if there's no SUBLANG.  The return value will be
                     the canonicalized locale, in proper CLIB form.)

                     If there is no value for this property, the MS Windows
                     locale is assumed to have the same name as the
                     language environment.

  invalid-sequence-coding-system
                     VALUE is a fixed-width 8-bit coding system used to
                     display Unicode error sequences (using a face to make
                     it clear that the data is invalid).  In Western Europe
                     and the Americas this is normally windows-1252; in
                     Russia and the former Soviet Union koi8-ru or
                     windows-1251 makes more sense."
