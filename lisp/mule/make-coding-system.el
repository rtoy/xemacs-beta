  "Register symbol NAME as a coding system.

TYPE describes the conversion method used and should be one of

nil or `undecided'
     Automatic conversion.  XEmacs attempts to detect the coding system
     used in the file.
`chain'
     Chain two or more coding systems together to make a combination coding
     system.
`no-conversion'
     No conversion.  Use this for binary files and such.  On output,
     graphic characters that are not in ASCII or Latin-1 will be
     replaced by a ?. (For a no-conversion-encoded buffer, these
     characters will only be present if you explicitly insert them.)
`convert-eol'
     Convert CRLF sequences or CR to LF.
`shift-jis'
     Shift-JIS (a Japanese encoding commonly used in PC operating systems).
`multibyte'
     An encoding that directly encodes the indices of one or more charsets
     with one or two bytes.
`unicode'
     Any Unicode encoding (UCS-4, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.).
`mswindows-unicode-to-multibyte'
     (MS Windows only) Converts from Windows Unicode to Windows Multibyte
     (any code page encoding) upon encoding, and the other way upon decoding.
`mswindows-multibyte'
     Converts to or from Windows Multibyte (any code page encoding).
     This is resolved into a chain of `mswindows-unicode' and
     `mswindows-unicode-to-multibyte'.
`iso2022'
     Any ISO2022-compliant encoding.  Among other things, this includes
     JIS (the Japanese encoding commonly used for e-mail), EUC (the
     standard Unix encoding for Japanese and other languages), and
     Compound Text (the encoding used in X11).  You can specify more
     specific information about the conversion with the PROPS argument.
`fixed-width'
     A fixed-width eight bit encoding that is not necessarily compliant with
     ISO 2022.  This coding system assumes Unicode equivalency, that is, if
     two given XEmacs characters have the same Unicode mapping, they will
     always map to the same octet on disk.
`big5'
     Big5 (the encoding commonly used for Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan).
`ccl'
     The conversion is performed using a user-written pseudo-code
     program.  CCL (Code Conversion Language) is the name of this
     pseudo-code.  Not available when (featurep 'unicode-internal).
`gzip'
     GZIP compression format.
`internal'
     Write out or read in the raw contents of the memory representing
     the buffer's text.  This is primarily useful for debugging
     purposes, and is only enabled when XEmacs has been compiled with
     DEBUG_XEMACS defined (via the --debug configure option).
     WARNING: Reading in a file using `internal' conversion can result
     in an internal inconsistency in the memory representing a
     buffer's text, which will produce unpredictable results and may
     cause XEmacs to crash.  Under normal circumstances you should
     never use `internal' conversion.

DESCRIPTION is a short English phrase describing the coding system,
suitable for use as a menu item. (See also the `documentation' property
below.)

PROPS is a property list, describing the specific nature of the
character set.  Recognized properties are:

`mnemonic'
     String to be displayed in the modeline when this coding system is
     active.

`documentation'
     Detailed documentation on the coding system.

`aliases'
     A list of aliases for the coding system.  See
     `define-coding-system-alias'.

`eol-type'
     End-of-line conversion to be used.  It should be one of

	nil
		Automatically detect the end-of-line type (LF, CRLF,
		or CR).  Also generate subsidiary coding systems named
		`NAME-unix', `NAME-dos', and `NAME-mac', that are
		identical to this coding system but have an EOL-TYPE
		value of `lf', `crlf', and `cr', respectively.
	`lf'
		The end of a line is marked externally using ASCII LF.
		Since this is also the way that XEmacs represents an
		end-of-line internally, specifying this option results
		in no end-of-line conversion.  This is the standard
		format for Unix text files.
	`crlf'
		The end of a line is marked externally using ASCII
		CRLF.  This is the standard format for MS-DOS text
		files.
	`cr'
		The end of a line is marked externally using ASCII CR.
		This is the standard format for Macintosh text files.
	t
		Automatically detect the end-of-line type but do not
		generate subsidiary coding systems.  (This value is
		converted to nil when stored internally, and
		`coding-system-property' will return nil.)

`post-read-conversion'
     The value is a function to call after some text is inserted and
     decoded by the coding system itself and before any functions in
     `after-change-functions' are called. (#### Not actually true in
     XEmacs. `after-change-functions' will be called twice if
     `post-read-conversion' changes something.) The argument of this
     function is the same as for a function in
     `after-insert-file-functions', i.e. LENGTH of the text inserted,
     with point at the head of the text to be decoded.

`pre-write-conversion'
     The value is a function to call after all functions in
     `write-region-annotate-functions' and `buffer-file-format' are
     called, and before the text is encoded by the coding system itself.
     The arguments to this function are the same as those of a function
     in `write-region-annotate-functions', i.e. FROM and TO, specifying
     a region of text.

The following properties are used by `default-query-coding-region',
the default implementation of `query-coding-region'. This
implementation and these properties are not used by the Unicode coding
systems, nor by fixed-width coding systems. 

`safe-chars'
     The value is a char table.  If a character has non-nil value in it,
     the character is safely supported by the coding system.  
     This overrides the `safe-charsets' property.
   
`safe-charsets'
     The value is a list of charsets safely supported by the coding
     system.  For coding systems based on ISO 2022, XEmacs may try to
     encode characters outside these character sets, but outside of
     East Asia and East Asian coding systems, it is unlikely that
     consumers of the data will understand XEmacs' encoding.
     The value t means that all XEmacs character sets handles are supported.  

The following properties are allowed for FSF compatibility but currently
ignored:

`translation-table-for-decode'
     The value is a translation table to be applied on decoding.  See
     the function `make-translation-table' for the format of translation
     table.  This is not applicable to CCL-based coding systems.
    
`translation-table-for-encode'
     The value is a translation table to be applied on encoding.  This is
     not applicable to CCL-based coding systems.
     
`mime-charset'
     The value is a symbol of which name is `MIME-charset' parameter of
     the coding system.
    
`valid-codes' (meaningful only for a coding system based on CCL)
     The value is a list to indicate valid byte ranges of the encoded
     file.  Each element of the list is an integer or a cons of integer.
     In the former case, the integer value is a valid byte code.  In the
     latter case, the integers specifies the range of valid byte codes.

The following additional property is recognized if TYPE is `convert-eol':

`subtype'
     One of `lf', `crlf', `cr' or nil (for autodetection).  When decoding,
     the corresponding sequence will be converted to LF.  When encoding,
     the opposite happens.  This coding system converts characters to
     characters.



The following additional properties are recognized if TYPE is `iso2022':

`charset-g0'
`charset-g1'
`charset-g2'
`charset-g3'
     The character set initially designated to the G0 - G3 registers.
     The value should be one of

          -- A charset object (designate that character set)
	  -- nil (do not ever use this register)
	  -- t (no character set is initially designated to
		the register, but may be later on; this automatically
		sets the corresponding `force-g*-on-output' property)

`force-g0-on-output'
`force-g1-on-output'
`force-g2-on-output'
`force-g2-on-output'
     If non-nil, send an explicit designation sequence on output before
     using the specified register.

`short'
     If non-nil, use the short forms \"ESC $ @\", \"ESC $ A\", and
     \"ESC $ B\" on output in place of the full designation sequences
     \"ESC $ ( @\", \"ESC $ ( A\", and \"ESC $ ( B\".

`no-ascii-eol'
     If non-nil, don't designate ASCII to G0 at each end of line on output.
     Setting this to non-nil also suppresses other state-resetting that
     normally happens at the end of a line.

`no-ascii-cntl'
     If non-nil, don't designate ASCII to G0 before control chars on output.

`seven'
     If non-nil, use 7-bit environment on output.  Otherwise, use 8-bit
     environment.

`lock-shift'
     If non-nil, use locking-shift (SO/SI) instead of single-shift
     or designation by escape sequence.

`no-iso6429'
     If non-nil, don't use ISO6429's direction specification.

`escape-quoted'
     If non-nil, literal control characters that are the same as
     the beginning of a recognized ISO2022 or ISO6429 escape sequence
     (in particular, ESC (0x1B), SO (0x0E), SI (0x0F), SS2 (0x8E),
     SS3 (0x8F), and CSI (0x9B)) are \"quoted\" with an escape character
     so that they can be properly distinguished from an escape sequence.
     (Note that doing this results in a non-portable encoding.) This
     encoding flag is used for byte-compiled files.  Note that ESC
     is a good choice for a quoting character because there are no
     escape sequences whose second byte is a character from the Control-0
     or Control-1 character sets; this is explicitly disallowed by the
     ISO2022 standard.

`iso2022-preserve'
     If non-nil, preserve round-trip conversion even when Unicode is used
     as an internal representation, by using private characters from the
     Unicode space.  WARNING: This will make such characters unusable for
     normal editing purposes.

`input-charset-conversion'
     A list of conversion specifications, specifying conversion of
     characters in one charset to another when decoding is performed.
     Each specification is a list of two elements: the source charset,
     and the destination charset.

`output-charset-conversion'
     A list of conversion specifications, specifying conversion of
     characters in one charset to another when encoding is performed.
     The form of each specification is the same as for
     `input-charset-conversion'.

The following additional properties are recognized if TYPE is
`fixed-width':

`unicode-map'
     Required.  A plist describing a map from octets in the coding system
     NAME (as integers) to XEmacs characters.  Those XEmacs characters will
     be used explicitly on decoding, but for encoding (most relevantly, on
     writing to disk) XEmacs characters that map to the same Unicode code
     point will be unified.  This means that the ISO-8859-? characters that
     map to the same Unicode code point will not be distinct when written to
     disk, which is normally what is intended; it also means that East Asian
     Han characters from different XEmacs character sets will not be
     distinct when written to disk, which is less often what is intended.

     Any octets not mapped, and with values above #x7f, will be decoded into
     XEmacs characters that reflect that their values are undefined.  These
     characters will be displayed in a language-environment-specific
     way. See `unicode-error-default-translation-table' and the
     `invalid-sequence-coding-system' argument to `set-language-info'.

     These characters will normally be treated as invalid when checking
     whether text can be encoded with `query-coding-region'--see the
     IGNORE-INVALID-SEQUENCESP argument to that function to avoid this.  It
     is possible to specify that octets with values less than #x80 (or
     indeed greater than it) be treated in this way, by specifying
     explicitly that they correspond to the character mapping to that octet
     in `unicode-error-default-translation-table'.  Far fewer coding systems
     override the ASCII mapping, though, so this is not the default.

`encode-failure-octet'
     An integer between 0 and 255 to write in place of XEmacs characters
     that cannot be encoded, defaulting to the code for tilde `~'.

The following additional properties are recognized (and required)
if TYPE is `ccl':

`decode'
     CCL program used for decoding (converting to internal format).

`encode'
     CCL program used for encoding (converting to external format).


The following additional properties are recognized if TYPE is `chain':

`chain'
     List of coding systems to be chained together, in decoding order.

`canonicalize-after-coding'
     Coding system to be returned by the detector routines in place of
     this coding system.



The following additional properties are recognized if TYPE is `unicode':

`unicode-type'
     One of `utf-16', `utf-8', `ucs-4', or `utf-7' (the latter is not
     yet implemented).  `utf-16' is the basic two-byte encoding;
     `ucs-4' is the four-byte encoding; `utf-8' is an ASCII-compatible
     variable-width 8-bit encoding; `utf-7' is a 7-bit encoding using
     only characters that will safely pass through all mail gateways.
     [[ This should be \"transformation format\".  There should also be
     `ucs-2' (or `bmp' -- no surrogates) and `utf-32' (range checked). ]]

`little-endian'
     If non-nil, `utf-16' and `ucs-4' will write out the groups of two
     or four bytes little-endian instead of big-endian.  This is required,
     for example, under Windows.

`need-bom'
     If non-nil, a byte order mark (BOM, or Unicode FFFE) should be
     written out at the beginning of the data.  This serves both to
     identify the endianness of the following data and to mark the
     data as Unicode (at least, this is how Windows uses it).
     [[ The correct term is \"signature\", since this technique may also
     be used with UTF-8.  That is the term used in the standard. ]]


The following additional property is recognized if TYPE is `multibyte':

`charsets'
     List of charsets encoded using this coding system.


The following additional properties are recognized if TYPE is
`mswindows-multibyte':

`code-page'
     Either a number (specifying a particular code page) or one of the
     symbols `ansi', `oem', `mac', or `ebcdic', specifying the ANSI,
     OEM, Macintosh, or EBCDIC code page associated with a particular
     locale (given by the `locale' property).  NOTE: EBCDIC code pages
     only exist in Windows 2000 and later.

`locale'
     If `code-page' is a symbol, this specifies the locale whose code
     page of the corresponding type should be used.  This should be
     one of the following: A cons of two strings, (LANGUAGE
     . SUBLANGUAGE) (see `mswindows-set-current-locale'); a string (a
     language; SUBLANG_DEFAULT, i.e. the default sublanguage, is
     used); or one of the symbols `current', `user-default', or
     `system-default', corresponding to the values of
     `mswindows-current-locale', `mswindows-user-default-locale', or
     `mswindows-system-default-locale', respectively.


The following additional properties are recognized if TYPE is `undecided':
\[[ Doesn't GNU use \"detect-*\" for the following two? ]]

`do-eol'
     Do EOL detection.

`do-coding'
     Do encoding detection.

`coding-system'
     If encoding detection is not done, use the specified coding system
     to do decoding.  This is used internally when implementing coding
     systems with an EOL type that specifies autodetection (the default),
     so that the detector routines return the proper subsidiary.



The following additional property is recognized if TYPE is `gzip':

`level'
     Compression level: 0 through 9, or `default' (currently 6)."
