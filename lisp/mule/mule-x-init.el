  "Maybe set charset registry of the 'ascii charset to ROMAN-REGISTRY.

Do this only if:
 - the current display is an X device
 - the displayed width of FULLWIDTH-CHARSET is twice the displayed
   width of the 'ascii charset, but only when using ROMAN-REGISTRY.

Traditionally, Asian characters have been displayed so that they
occupy exactly twice the screen space of ASCII (`halfwidth')
characters.  On many systems, e.g. Sun CDE systems, this can only be
achieved by using a national variant roman font to display ASCII."
