;;; Commentary:

;; This file is dumped with XEmacs.

;; It handles the all aspects of startup once the C code has finished
;; initializing itself.  Entry from C is through the function set in
;; the `top-level' variable, which is normally `normal-top-level'.  At
;; the point that `normal-top-level' has been invoked:
;;
;; (1) the dumped Elisp files are available.  Either they were loaded
;;     during this invocation of temacs and it was then converted to
;;     XEmacs using the run-temacs mechanism, or (more likely) the
;;     loadup and dumping occurred at some point in the past and we
;;     just read in the dumped data.
;;
;; (2) All C subsystems have been initialized.
;;
;; (3) A "stream" device has been created, which does I/O over stdin
;;     and stdout.  This is the only device we have available and our
;;     only means of communication, other than disk files.
;;
;; (4) The command-line arguments have been sorted according to
;;     priority specs (this implies that the names of all arguments
;;     must be hard-coded into emacs.c), and certain low-level
;;     arguments such as -sd, -t, -nd, -nw, -batch, etc. have been
;;     processed by main_1() and removed. (NOTE: main_1() is the name
;;     in the source code, but in the object file it has some other
;;     name, such as xemacs_21_2_34_mips_sgi_irix6().) Certain other
;;     arguments such as -version and -help are partially-processed,
;;     triggering some special behavior but being left on the list for
;;     further processing by the Lisp code.
;;
;; The job of the code here is to process the remaining command-line
;; args, set up the various paths, locate where all the packages are
;; and set things up for them (initialize the load path, read in the
;; autoloads, etc.), read in the init files, display the splash
;; screen, and set up any remaining environment-dependent variables.

Display options:

  -nw                   Open the initial frame on the current TTY, instead of
                        a window system.
  -t <device>           Use TTY <device> instead of the current TTY for input
                        and output.  This implies the -nw option.
  -display <display>    Standard X option, to specify the display connection.
                        If this option is given, or if the environment
                        variable DISPLAY is set, an initial X frame will be
                        created.  Otherwise, an initial Windows frame will be
                        created if Windows support exists and neither -nw nor
                        -t is given.  Otherwise, a TTY frame is created.
  -unmapped             Do not display the initial frame.  Useful to create
                        a \"server\" that can accept `gnuclient' connections.
  -tty                  Create the initial frame on the given window system.
  -x                    (Requesting an unsupported window system, or giving
  -gtk                  conflicting window systems, is a fatal error.)
  -gnome
  -msw

Noninteractive options:

  {-help}
  {-version}
  {-V}
  -batch                Execute noninteractively (messages go to stderr, no
                        initial frame created).
  {-funcall}
                        (The function may parse the rest of the command line
                        for its arguments.)
  {-f}
  {-eval}
  {-load}
  {-l}
  {-insert}
  {-i}
  {-kill}
  -sd                   Show dump ID.  Ignored when configured without --pdump.
  -nd                   Don't load the dump file.  Roughly like old temacs.
                        Ignored when configured without --pdump.

Initialization files:

  -no-init-file         Do not load the user-specific init file.
  -q                    Same as -no-init-file.
  -debug-init           Enter the debugger if an error in the init file occurs.
  -user-init-file <file>
                        Use <file> as init file.
  -user-init-directory <directory>
                        Use <directory> as init directory.
  -user <user>          Load user's init file instead of your own.
  -u <user>             Same as -user.
  -no-site-file         Do not load the site-specific init file
                        (site-start.el).

Package/module options:

  -vanilla		Equivalent to -q -no-site-file -no-early-packages.
                        Useful if you think some user-init or site-init code
                        is messing things up, or when running XEmacs in
                        batch mode.
  -no-autoloads		Do not load global symbol files (auto-autoloads) at
			startup.  Also implies `-vanilla'.
  -no-packages          Pretend like the packages don't exist.  Don't put
                        any packages in the load path or set up any package
                        autoloads.  Also implies `-vanilla'.  Use this when
                        running XEmacs in batch mode when you aren't using
                        any functionality in packages and want to make sure
                        that you get no interference from packages
                        (e.g. Lisp files that shadow core Lisp files).
  -no-early-packages	Do not process early packages.
  -debug-paths          Display info about the runtime values of various
                        directory variables (e.g. for loading packages).
  -no-site-modules      Do not search site-modules directories for modules
                        at startup.  Only applies when modules support is
                        compiled into XEmacs.

Encoding options:

  -eol                  Turn on EOL detection (only applies to Unix, no
                        international support; otherwise EOL detection is
                        already on).
  -nuni                 Under MS Windows, disable use of the Unicode versions
                        of API calls.  Not for Windows 95/98/ME.  This is
                        mostly only useful for debugging purposes.
