;;; Commentary:

;; This file is dumped with XEmacs.

;; This file contains functions and variables that describe and construct
;; the various paths into the XEmacs hierarchy from a global viewpoint.

;; This file doesn't actually set any global variable, and doesn't
;; contain any state---it just contains the functionality for
;; searching directories and constructing paths.

;; It requires find-paths.el and packages.el.
