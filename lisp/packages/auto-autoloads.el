Each element should be of the form:

 MATCHER
 (MATCHER . MATCH)
 (MATCHER . FACENAME)
 (MATCHER . HIGHLIGHT)
 (MATCHER HIGHLIGHT ...)
 (eval . FORM)

where HIGHLIGHT should be either MATCH-HIGHLIGHT or MATCH-ANCHORED.

FORM is an expression, whose value should be a keyword element,
evaluated when the keyword is (first) used in a buffer.  This feature
can be used to provide a keyword that can only be generated when Font
Lock mode is actually turned on.

For highlighting single items, typically only MATCH-HIGHLIGHT is required.
However, if an item or (typically) items is to be highlighted following the
instance of another item (the anchor) then MATCH-ANCHORED may be required.

MATCH-HIGHLIGHT should be of the form:

 (MATCH FACENAME OVERRIDE LAXMATCH)

Where MATCHER can be either the regexp to search for, a variable
containing the regexp to search for, or the function to call to make
the search (called with one argument, the limit of the search).  MATCH
is the subexpression of MATCHER to be highlighted.  FACENAME is either
a symbol naming a face, or an expression whose value is the face name
to use.  If you want FACENAME to be a symbol that evaluates to a face,
use a form like \"(progn sym)\".

OVERRIDE and LAXMATCH are flags.  If OVERRIDE is t, existing fontification may
be overwritten.  If `keep', only parts not already fontified are highlighted.
If `prepend' or `append', existing fontification is merged with the new, in
which the new or existing fontification, respectively, takes precedence.
If LAXMATCH is non-nil, no error is signalled if there is no MATCH in MATCHER.

For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):

 \"\\\\\\=<foo\\\\\\=>\"		Discrete occurrences of \"foo\" in the value of the
			variable `font-lock-keyword-face'.
 (\"fu\\\\(bar\\\\)\" . 1)	Substring \"bar\" within all occurrences of \"fubar\" in
			the value of `font-lock-keyword-face'.
 (\"fubar\" . fubar-face)	Occurrences of \"fubar\" in the value of `fubar-face'.
 (\"foo\\\\|bar\" 0 foo-bar-face t)
			Occurrences of either \"foo\" or \"bar\" in the value
			of `foo-bar-face', even if already highlighted.

MATCH-ANCHORED should be of the form:

 (MATCHER PRE-MATCH-FORM POST-MATCH-FORM MATCH-HIGHLIGHT ...)

Where MATCHER is as for MATCH-HIGHLIGHT with one exception.  The limit of the
search is currently guaranteed to be (no greater than) the end of the line.
PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are evaluated before the first, and after
the last, instance MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER is used.  Therefore they can be
used to initialise before, and cleanup after, MATCHER is used.  Typically,
PRE-MATCH-FORM is used to move to some position relative to the original
MATCHER, before starting with MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER.  POST-MATCH-FORM might
be used to move, before resuming with MATCH-ANCHORED's parent's MATCHER.

For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):

 (\"\\\\\\=<anchor\\\\\\=>\" (0 anchor-face) (\"\\\\\\=<item\\\\\\=>\" nil nil (0 item-face)))

 Discrete occurrences of \"anchor\" in the value of `anchor-face', and subsequent
 discrete occurrences of \"item\" (on the same line) in the value of `item-face'.
 (Here PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are nil.  Therefore \"item\" is
 initially searched for starting from the end of the match of \"anchor\", and
 searching for subsequent instance of \"anchor\" resumes from where searching
 for \"item\" concluded.)

Note that the MATCH-ANCHORED feature is experimental; in the future, we may
replace it with other ways of providing this functionality.

These regular expressions should not match text which spans lines.  While
\\[font-lock-fontify-buffer] handles multi-line patterns correctly, updating
when you edit the buffer does not, since it considers text one line at a time.

Be very careful composing regexps for this list;
the wrong pattern can dramatically slow things down!")

cursor movement bindings are the same (ie. Use \\[hexl-backward-char], \\[hexl-forward-char], \\[hexl-next-line], and \\[hexl-previous-line]
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up).

Advanced cursor movement commands (ala \\[hexl-beginning-of-line], \\[hexl-end-of-line], \\[hexl-beginning-of-buffer], and \\[hexl-end-of-buffer]) are
also supported.

There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:

ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.

\\[hexl-quoted-insert] followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.

\\[hexl-insert-hex-char] will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-octal-char] will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-decimal-char] will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-mode-exit] will exit hexl-mode.

Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.

You can use \\[hexl-find-file] to visit a file in hexl-mode.

An alist of dictionaries and their associated parameters.

        ISPELL-ARGS EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE)

DICTIONARY-NAME is a possible value of variable `ispell-dictionary', nil
means the default dictionary.

CASECHARS is a regular expression of valid characters that comprise a
word.

NOT-CASECHARS is the opposite regexp of CASECHARS.

OTHERCHARS is a regular expression of other characters that are valid
in word constructs.  Otherchars cannot be adjacent to each other in a
word, nor can they begin or end a word.  This implies we can't check
\"Stevens'\" as a correct possessive and other correct formations.

Hint: regexp syntax requires the hyphen to be declared first here.

MANY-OTHERCHARS-P is non-nil if many otherchars are to be allowed in a
word instead of only one.

ISPELL-ARGS is a list of additional arguments passed to the ispell
subprocess.

EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE should be used when dictionaries are used which
have been configured in an Ispell affix file.  (For example, umlauts
can be encoded as \\\"a, a\\\", \"a, ...)  Defaults are ~tex and ~nroff
in English.  This has the same effect as the command-line `-T' option.
The buffer Major Mode controls Ispell's parsing in tex or nroff mode,
but the dictionary can control the extended character mode.
Both defaults can be overruled in a buffer-local fashion. See
`ispell-parsing-keyword' for details on this.

Note that the CASECHARS and OTHERCHARS slots of the alist should
contain the same character set as casechars and otherchars in the
language.aff file (e.g., english.aff).")
