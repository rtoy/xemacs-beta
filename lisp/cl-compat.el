;;; Synched up with: FSF 21.3.

;;; Commentary:

;; These are extensions to Emacs Lisp that provide a degree of
;; Common Lisp compatibility, beyond what is already built-in
;; in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; This package was written by Dave Gillespie; it is a complete
;; rewrite of Cesar Quiroz's original cl.el package of December 1986.
;;
;; This package works with Emacs 18, Emacs 19, and XEmacs/Lucid Emacs 19.
;;
;; Bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome!

;; This file contains emulations of internal routines of the older
;; CL package which users may have called directly from their code.
;; Use (require 'cl-compat) to get these routines.

;; See cl.el for Change Log.


;;; Code:

;; Require at load-time, but not when compiling cl-compat.
(or (featurep 'cl) (require 'cl))


;;; Keyword routines not supported by new package.

  (or (keywordp sym) (keywordp (read (format ":%s" sym)))))

;;; Routines for parsing keyword arguments.

;; The rounding functions in C now have all the functionality this package
;; used to:
