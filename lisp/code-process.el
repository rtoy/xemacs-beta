(defvar process-coding-system-alist nil
  "Alist to decide a coding system to use for a process I/O operation.
The format is ((PATTERN . VAL) ...),
where PATTERN is a regular expression matching a program name,
VAL is a coding system, a cons of coding systems, or a function symbol.
If VAL is a coding system, it is used for both decoding what received
from the program and encoding what sent to the program.
If VAL is a cons of coding systems, the car part is used for decoding,
and the cdr part is used for encoding.
If VAL is a function symbol, it is called with two arguments, a symbol
indicating the operation being performed (one of `start-process',
`call-process', `open-network-stream', or `open-multicast-group') and the
program name.  The function must return a coding system or a cons of
coding systems which are used as above.")

(defun call-process (program &optional infile buffer displayp &rest args)
  "Call PROGRAM synchronously in separate process.

The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').
XEmacs feature: INFILE can also be a list of (BUFFER [START [END]]), i.e.
a list of one to three elements, consisting of a buffer and optionally
a start position or start and end position.  In this case, input comes
from the buffer, starting from START (defaults to the beginning of the
buffer) and ending at END (defaults to the end of the buffer).

Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer;
 nil for BUFFER means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait.
If BUFFER is a string, then find or create a buffer with that name,
then insert the output in that buffer, before point.
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),
t (mix it with ordinary output), a file name string, or (XEmacs feature)
a buffer object.  If STDERR-FILE is a buffer object (but not the name of
a buffer, since that would be interpreted as a file), the standard error
output will be inserted into the buffer before point.

Fourth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.
Remaining arguments are strings passed as command arguments to PROGRAM.

If BUFFER is 0, returns immediately with value nil.
Otherwise waits for PROGRAM to terminate and returns a numeric exit status
or a signal description string.  If you quit, the process is first killed
with SIGINT, then with SIGKILL if you quit again before the process exits.

If INFILE is a file, we transfer its exact contents to the process without
any encoding/decoding. (#### This policy might change.)

Otherwise, the read/write coding systems used for process I/O on the
process are determined as follows:

1. `coding-system-for-read', `coding-system-for-write', if non-nil.
      (Intended as a temporary overriding mechanism for use by Lisp
      code.)
2. The matching value for the process name from `process-coding-system-alist',
      if any, and if non-nil.  The value may be either a single coding
      system, used for both read and write; or a cons of read/write; or a
      function, called to get one of the other two values.
3. For writing: If a buffer was given in INFILE, the value of
      `buffer-file-coding-system' in that buffer.
   For reading: if a buffer was given in BUFFER, the value of
      `buffer-file-coding-system-for-read' in that buffer.
4. The value of `default-process-coding-system', which should be a cons
      of read/write coding systems, if the values are non-nil.
5. The coding system `undecided' for read, and `raw-text' for write.

Note that the processes of determining the read and write coding systems
proceed essentially independently one from the other, as in `start-process'."

If BUFFER is 0, returns immediately with value nil.
Otherwise waits for PROGRAM to terminate and returns a numeric exit status

The read/write coding systems used for process I/O on the process are
the same as for `call-process'."

(defun start-process (name buffer program &rest program-args)
  "Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer or (buffer-name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer.
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-BUFFER); in that case,
 REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
 while STDERR-BUFFER says what to do with standard error in the child.
 STDERR-BUFFER may be nil (discard standard error output, unless a stderr
 filter is set).  Note that if you do not use this form at process creation,
 stdout and stderr will be mixed in the output buffer, and this cannot be
 changed, even by setting a stderr filter.
Third arg is program file name.  It is searched for as in the shell.
Remaining arguments are strings to give program as arguments.

The read/write coding systems used for process I/O on the process are
determined as follows:

1. `coding-system-for-read', `coding-system-for-write', if non-nil.
      (Intended as a temporary overriding mechanism for use by Lisp
      code.)
2. The matching value for the process name from `process-coding-system-alist',
      if any, and if non-nil.  The value may be either a single coding
      system, used for both read and write; or a cons of read/write; or a
      function, called to get one of the other two values.
3. The value of `default-process-coding-system', which should be a cons
      of read/write coding systems, if the values are non-nil.
4. The coding system `undecided' for read, and `raw-text' for write.

Note that the processes of determining the read and write coding systems
proceed essentially independently one from the other.  For example, a value
determined from `process-coding-system-alist' might specify a read coding
system but not a write coding system, in which the read coding system is as
specified and the write coding system comes from proceeding to step 3 (and
looking in `default-process-coding-system').

You can change the coding systems later on using
`set-process-coding-system', `set-process-input-coding-system', or
`set-process-output-coding-system'.

(defvar network-coding-system-alist nil
  "Alist to decide a coding system to use for a network I/O operation.

VAL is a coding system, a cons of coding systems, or a function symbol.

If VAL is a cons of coding systems, the car part is used for decoding,

(defun open-network-stream (name buffer host service &optional protocol)
  "Open a TCP connection for a service to a host.
Return a process object to represent the connection.
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer.
Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.
Fourth arg SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an integer
 specifying a port number to connect to.
Fifth argument PROTOCOL is a network protocol.  Currently 'tcp
 (Transmission Control Protocol) and 'udp (User Datagram Protocol) are
 supported.  When omitted, 'tcp is assumed.

Output via `process-send-string' and input via buffer or filter (see
`set-process-filter') are stream-oriented.  That means UDP datagrams are
not guaranteed to be sent and received in discrete packets. (But small
datagrams around 500 bytes that are not truncated by `process-send-string'
are usually fine.)  Note further that UDP protocol does not guard against 
lost packets.

The read/write coding systems used for process I/O on the process are
determined as follows:

1. `coding-system-for-read', `coding-system-for-write', if non-nil.
