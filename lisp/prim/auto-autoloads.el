(defvar diary-file "~/diary" "\
*Name of the file in which one's personal diary of dates is kept.

The file's entries are lines in any of the forms

            MONTH/DAY
            MONTH/DAY/YEAR
            MONTHNAME DAY
            MONTHNAME DAY, YEAR
            DAYNAME

at the beginning of the line; the remainder of the line is the diary entry
string for that date.  MONTH and DAY are one or two digit numbers, YEAR is
a number and may be written in full or abbreviated to the final two digits.
If the date does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year.
DAYNAME entries apply to any date on which is on that day of the week.
MONTHNAME and DAYNAME can be spelled in full, abbreviated to three
characters (with or without a period), capitalized or not.  Any of DAY,
MONTH, or MONTHNAME, YEAR can be `*' which matches any day, month, or year,
respectively.

The European style (in which the day precedes the month) can be used
instead, if you execute `european-calendar' when in the calendar, or set
`european-calendar-style' to t in your .emacs file.  The European forms are

            DAY/MONTH
            DAY/MONTH/YEAR
            DAY MONTHNAME
            DAY MONTHNAME YEAR
            DAYNAME

To revert to the default American style from the European style, execute
`american-calendar' in the calendar.

A diary entry can be preceded by the character
`diary-nonmarking-symbol' (ordinarily `&') to make that entry
nonmarking--that is, it will not be marked on dates in the calendar
window but will appear in a diary window.

Multiline diary entries are made by indenting lines after the first with
either a TAB or one or more spaces.

Lines not in one the above formats are ignored.  Here are some sample diary
entries (in the default American style):

     12/22/1988 Twentieth wedding anniversary!!
     &1/1. Happy New Year!
     10/22 Ruth's birthday.
     21: Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89 Friday the thirteenth!!
     &thu 4pm squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16 Dad's birthday
     April 15, 1989 Income tax due.
     &* 15 time cards due.

If the first line of a diary entry consists only of the date or day name with
no trailing blanks or punctuation, then that line is not displayed in the
diary window; only the continuation lines is shown.  For example, the
single diary entry

     02/11/1989
      Bill Blattner visits Princeton today
      2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
      2:30-5:30 Lizzie at Lawrenceville for `Group Initiative'
      4:00pm Jamie Tappenden
      7:30pm Dinner at George and Ed's for Alan Ryan
      7:30-10:00pm dance at Stewart Country Day School

will appear in the diary window without the date line at the beginning.  This
facility allows the diary window to look neater, but can cause confusion if
used with more than one day's entries displayed.

Diary entries can be based on Lisp sexps.  For example, the diary entry

      %%(diary-block 11 1 1990 11 10 1990) Vacation

causes the diary entry \"Vacation\" to appear from November 1 through November
10, 1990.  Other functions available are `diary-float', `diary-anniversary',
`diary-cyclic', `diary-day-of-year', `diary-iso-date', `diary-french-date',
`diary-hebrew-date', `diary-islamic-date', `diary-mayan-date',
`diary-yahrzeit', `diary-sunrise-sunset', `diary-phases-of-moon',
`diary-parasha', `diary-omer', `diary-rosh-hodesh', and
`diary-sabbath-candles'.  See the documentation for the function
`list-sexp-diary-entries' for more details.

Diary entries based on the Hebrew and/or the Islamic calendar are also
possible, but because these are somewhat slow, they are ignored
unless you set the `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' and the
`nongregorian-diary-marking-hook' appropriately.  See the documentation
for these functions for details.

surrounded by the previous and next months.  The cursor is put on today's date.

If called with an optional prefix argument, prompts for month and year.

This function is suitable for execution in a .emacs file; appropriate setting
of the variable `view-diary-entries-initially' will cause the diary entries for
the current date to be displayed in another window.  The value of the variable
`number-of-diary-entries' controls the number of days of diary entries
displayed upon initial display of the calendar.

An optional prefix argument ARG causes the calendar displayed to be ARG
months in the future if ARG is positive or in the past if ARG is negative;
in this case the cursor goes on the first day of the month.

Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved into view.
Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar can be scrolled forward
or backward.

The cursor can be moved forward or backward by one day, one week, one month,
or one year.  All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the digit keys
and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  The window is replotted as
necessary to display the desired date.

Diary entries can be marked on the calendar or displayed in another window.

Use M-x describe-mode for details of the key bindings in the calendar window.

The Gregorian calendar is assumed.

After loading the calendar, the hooks given by the variable
`calendar-load-hook' are run.  This is the place to add key bindings to the
calendar-mode-map.

After preparing the calendar window initially, the hooks given by the variable
`initial-calendar-window-hook' are run.

The hooks given by the variable `today-visible-calendar-hook' are run
everytime the calendar window gets scrolled, if the current date is visible
in the window.  If it is not visible, the hooks given by the variable
`today-invisible-calendar-hook' are run.  Thus, for example, setting
`today-visible-calendar-hook' to 'calendar-star-date will cause today's date
to be replaced by asterisks to highlight it whenever it is in the window." t nil)

(autoload 'blackbox "blackbox" "\
Play blackbox.  Optional prefix argument is the number of balls;
the default is 4.

What is blackbox?

Blackbox is a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the
Blackbox).  Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several
balls (usually 4) within this box.  By shooting rays into the box and
observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of
the hidden balls.  The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower
your score.

Overview of play:

\\<blackbox-mode-map>To play blackbox, type \\[blackbox].  An optional prefix argument
specifies the number of balls to be hidden in the box; the default is
four.

The cursor can be moved around the box with the standard cursor
movement keys.

To shoot a ray, move the cursor to the edge of the box and press SPC.
The result will be determined and the playfield updated.

You may place or remove balls in the box by moving the cursor into the
box and pressing \\[bb-romp].

When you think the configuration of balls you have placed is correct,
press \\[bb-done].  You will be informed whether you are correct or
not, and be given your score.  Your score is the number of letters and
numbers around the outside of the box plus five for each incorrectly
placed ball.  If you placed any balls incorrectly, they will be
indicated with `x', and their actual positions indicated with `o'.

Details:

There are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:

	Detour: the ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than
		where you sent it in.  On the playfield, detours are
		denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the
		ray went in, and the other where it came out.

	Reflection: the ray is reflected and emerges in the same place
		it was sent in.  On the playfield, reflections are
		denoted by the letter `R'.

	Hit:	the ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed.  It does
		not emerge from the box.  On the playfield, hits are
		denoted by the letter `H'.

The rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by
example.

As a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees.  Rays can
be deflected multiple times.  In the diagrams below, the dashes
represent empty box locations and the letter `O' represents a ball.
The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers as
described under \"Detour\" above.  Note that the entrance and exit
points are always interchangeable.  `*' denotes the path taken by the
ray.

Note carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety
degree deflection it causes.

As mentioned above, a reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point
it was sent in.  This can happen in several ways:

                                                                           
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -

  - - - - O - - -         - - - * - - - -        R - - - - - - - -

  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       R * * * * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -

In the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper
ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to
its point of origin.  The second example is similar.  The third
example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the
ray never gets a chance to get into the box.  Alternatively, the ray
can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately
emerging from the box.

A hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -

Be sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of
a reflection." t nil)

Play Mine.  Optional prefix argument is the number of mines.

To play Mine, type `\\[mine]' or `\\[universal-argument] NUM \\[mine]'.  

An optional prefix argument specifies the number of mines to be hidden
in the field.  If no prefix argument is given, a percentage
`mine-mines-%' of the field will contain mines.

What is Mine?\\<mine-mode-map>

Mine is a classical game of hide and seek played on a rectangular grid
containing `mine-xmax' by `mine-ymax' squares (the mine field).

Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several mines within
this field.  The object of the game is to find every hidden mine.

When you're sure a square does NOT contain a mine, you can hit it:
move the mouse over the square and press `\\[mine-mouse-hit]' or 
move the cursor with the usual keys and press `\\[mine-hit-curpoint]'.

If the square is a mine, you loose.
If the square isn't a mine, a number appears which represents
the number of mines in the surrounding eight squares.  

When you think a square DOES contain a mine, you can mark it:
move the mouse over the square and press `\\[mine-mouse-mark]' or
move the cursor with the usual keys and press `\\[mine-mark-curpoint]'.

The number of hidden mines remaining in the mine field is indicated
inside the buffer.  Every time you mark a square as a mine, this
number decreases by one, even if you incorrectly mark a square.

If `mine-torus' is non-nil (the default), the Mine game is played over
a periodic field (like a torus).  Each mine is hidden periodically
over the mine board `mine-nb-tiles-x' times in the x direction and
`mine-nb-tiles-y' times in the y direction.

If `mine-colorp' is non-nil (the default, if the system allows it),
the game is displayed with colors.  The colors can be chosen with the
variable `mine-colors'.

If the redisplay is not fast enough, increase `mine-level'.  If you
want to see a smoother (slower) redisplay, decrease `mine-level',
`mine-count1-max' and `mine-count2-max'.

You can get help on `mine-mode' and its key bindings by pressing `\\[mine-help]'
while in the *Mine* buffer.

Minor mode which combines windows into one tall virtual window.

The feeling of a \"virtual window\" has been accomplished by the use
of two major techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer. 
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow Mode.)

* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another 
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This 
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor 
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side window are used. The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one. Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and beeing able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`\\[split-window-horizontally]' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each-other.

If the variable `follow-intercept-processes' is non-nil, Follow mode
will listen to the output of processes and redisplay accordingly.
\(This is the default.)

When Follow mode is switched on, the hook `follow-mode-hook'
is called.  When turned off, `follow-mode-off-hook' is called.

Keys specific to Follow mode:
\\{follow-mode-map}" t nil)

Execute this command to display as much as possible of the text

two windows always will display two successive pages.
\(If one window is moved, the other one will follow.)

If ARG is positive, the leftmost window is selected.  If it negative,
the rightmost is selected.  If ARG is nil, the leftmost window is
selected if the original window is the first one in the frame.

\\{makefile-mode-map}

In the browser, use the following keys:

\\{makefile-browser-map}

Makefile mode can be configured by modifying the following variables:

makefile-browser-buffer-name:
    Name of the macro- and target browser buffer.

makefile-target-colon:
    The string that gets appended to all target names
    inserted by `makefile-insert-target'.
    \":\" or \"::\" are quite common values.

makefile-macro-assign:
   The string that gets appended to all macro names
   inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.
   The normal value should be \" = \", since this is what
   standard make expects. However, newer makes such as dmake
   allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you
   might prefer to use \" += \" or \" := \" .

makefile-tab-after-target-colon:
   If you want a TAB (instead of a space) to be appended after the
   target colon, then set this to a non-nil value.

makefile-browser-leftmost-column:
   Number of blanks to the left of the browser selection mark.

makefile-browser-cursor-column:
   Column in which the cursor is positioned when it moves
   up or down in the browser.

makefile-browser-selected-mark:
   String used to mark selected entries in the browser.

makefile-browser-unselected-mark:
   String used to mark unselected entries in the browser.

makefile-browser-auto-advance-after-selection-p:
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value the cursor
   will automagically advance to the next line after an item
   has been selected in the browser.

makefile-pickup-everything-picks-up-filenames-p:
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then
   `makefile-pickup-everything' also picks up filenames as targets
   (i.e. it calls `makefile-find-filenames-as-targets'), otherwise
   filenames are omitted.

makefile-cleanup-continuations-p:
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then makefile-mode
   will assure that no line in the file ends with a backslash
   (the continuation character) followed by any whitespace.
   This is done by silently removing the trailing whitespace, leaving
   the backslash itself intact.
   IMPORTANT: Please note that enabling this option causes makefile-mode
   to MODIFY A FILE WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION when \"it seems necessary\".

makefile-browser-hook:
   A function or list of functions to be called just before the
   browser is entered. This is executed in the makefile buffer.

makefile-special-targets-list:
   List of special targets. You will be offered to complete
   on one of those in the minibuffer whenever you enter a `.'.
   at the beginning of a line in Makefile mode." t nil)

An extensive abbrevation table consisting of all the keywords of REXX are

(autoload 'sh-mode "sh-script" "\
Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.

The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:

\\[sh-case]	 case statement
\\[sh-for]	 for loop
\\[sh-function]	 function definition
\\[sh-if]	 if statement
\\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\\[sh-while-getopts]	 while getopts loop
\\[sh-repeat]	 repeat loop
\\[sh-select]	 select loop
\\[sh-until]	 until loop
\\[sh-while]	 while loop

\\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\\[sh-newline-and-indent]	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
\\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\\[sh-execute-region]	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.

\\[sh-maybe-here-document]	 Without prefix, following an unquoted < inserts here document.
{, (, [, ', \", `
	Unless quoted with \\, insert the pairs {}, (), [], or '', \"\", ``.

If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.

If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use \\[executable-interpret]

Major mode for editing Texinfo files.

  It has these extra commands:
\\{texinfo-mode-map}

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with \\[makeinfo-buffer] or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.

  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use \\[makeinfo-region], which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.

  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with \\[texinfo-show-structure].
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use \\[occur-mode-goto-occurrence], to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
\\[texinfo-insert-braces] and later use the command \\[up-list] to
move forward past the closing brace.

Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions

  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

Here are the functions:

    texinfo-update-node                \\[texinfo-update-node]
    texinfo-every-node-update          \\[texinfo-every-node-update]

    texinfo-make-menu                  \\[texinfo-make-menu]
    texinfo-all-menus-update           \\[texinfo-all-menus-update]
    texinfo-master-menu

    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented. 

Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.

*A list which determines which tags files should be active for a 
given buffer.  This is not really an association list, in that all 
elements are checked.  The CAR of each element of this list is a 
pattern against which the buffer's file name is compared; if it 
matches, then the CDR of the list should be the name of the tags
table to use.  If more than one element of this list matches the
buffer's file name, then all of the associated tags tables will be
used.  Earlier ones will be searched first.

If the CAR of elements of this list are strings, then they are treated
as regular-expressions against which the file is compared (like the
auto-mode-alist).  If they are not strings, then they are evaluated.
If they evaluate to non-nil, then the current buffer is considered to
match.

If the CDR of the elements of this list are strings, then they are
assumed to name a TAGS file.  If they name a directory, then the string
\"TAGS\" is appended to them to get the file name.  If they are not 
strings, then they are evaluated, and must return an appropriate string.

For example:
  (setq tag-table-alist
	'((\"/usr/src/public/perl/\" . \"/usr/src/public/perl/perl-3.0/\")
	 (\"\\\\.el$\" . \"/usr/local/emacs/src/\")
	 (\"/jbw/gnu/\" . \"/usr15/degree/stud/jbw/gnu/\")
	 (\"\" . \"/usr/local/emacs/src/\")
	 ))

This means that anything in the /usr/src/public/perl/ directory should use
the TAGS file /usr/src/public/perl/perl-3.0/TAGS; and file ending in .el should
use the TAGS file /usr/local/emacs/src/TAGS; and anything in or below the
directory /jbw/gnu/ should use the TAGS file /usr15/degree/stud/jbw/gnu/TAGS.
A file called something like \"/usr/jbw/foo.el\" would use both the TAGS files
/usr/local/emacs/src/TAGS and /usr15/degree/stud/jbw/gnu/TAGS (in that order)
because it matches both patterns.

If the buffer-local variable `buffer-tag-table' is set, then it names a tags
table that is searched before all others when find-tag is executed from this
buffer.

If there is a file called \"TAGS\" in the same directory as the file in 
question, then that tags file will always be used as well (after the
`buffer-tag-table' but before the tables specified by this list.)

If the variable tags-file-name is set, then the tags file it names will apply
to all buffers (for backwards compatibility.)  It is searched first.

where HIGHLIGHT should be either MATCH-HIGHLIGHT or MATCH-ANCHORED.

For highlighting single items, typically only MATCH-HIGHLIGHT is required.
However, if an item or (typically) items is to be hightlighted following the
instance of another item (the anchor) then MATCH-ANCHORED may be required.

MATCH-HIGHLIGHT should be of the form:

 (MATCH FACENAME OVERRIDE LAXMATCH)

Where MATCHER can be either the regexp to search for, or the function name to
call to make the search (called with one argument, the limit of the search).
MATCH is the subexpression of MATCHER to be highlighted.  FACENAME is either
a symbol naming a face, or an expression whose value is the face name to use.
If you want FACENAME to be a symbol that evaluates to a face, use a form
like \"(progn sym)\".

OVERRIDE and LAXMATCH are flags.  If OVERRIDE is t, existing fontification may
be overwritten.  If `keep', only parts not already fontified are highlighted.
If `prepend' or `append', existing fontification is merged with the new, in
which the new or existing fontification, respectively, takes precedence.
If LAXMATCH is non-nil, no error is signalled if there is no MATCH in MATCHER.

For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):

 \"\\\\\\=<foo\\\\\\=>\"		Discrete occurrences of \"foo\" in the value of the
			variable `font-lock-keyword-face'.
 (\"fu\\\\(bar\\\\)\" . 1)	Substring \"bar\" within all occurrences of \"fubar\" in
			the value of `font-lock-keyword-face'.
 (\"fubar\" . fubar-face)	Occurrences of \"fubar\" in the value of `fubar-face'.
 (\"foo\\\\|bar\" 0 foo-bar-face t)
			Occurrences of either \"foo\" or \"bar\" in the value
			of `foo-bar-face', even if already highlighted.

MATCH-ANCHORED should be of the form:

 (MATCHER PRE-MATCH-FORM POST-MATCH-FORM MATCH-HIGHLIGHT ...)

Where MATCHER is as for MATCH-HIGHLIGHT with one exception.  The limit of the
search is currently guaranteed to be (no greater than) the end of the line.
PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are evaluated before the first, and after
the last, instance MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER is used.  Therefore they can be
used to initialise before, and cleanup after, MATCHER is used.  Typically,
PRE-MATCH-FORM is used to move to some position relative to the original
MATCHER, before starting with MATCH-ANCHORED's MATCHER.  POST-MATCH-FORM might
be used to move, before resuming with MATCH-ANCHORED's parent's MATCHER.

For example, an element of the form highlights (if not already highlighted):

 (\"\\\\\\=<anchor\\\\\\=>\" (0 anchor-face) (\"\\\\\\=<item\\\\\\=>\" nil nil (0 item-face)))

 Discrete occurrences of \"anchor\" in the value of `anchor-face', and subsequent
 discrete occurrences of \"item\" (on the same line) in the value of `item-face'.
 (Here PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are nil.  Therefore \"item\" is
 initially searched for starting from the end of the match of \"anchor\", and
 searching for subsequent instance of \"anchor\" resumes from where searching
 for \"item\" concluded.)

Note that the MATCH-ANCHORED feature is experimental; in the future, we may
replace it with other ways of providing this functionality.

These regular expressions should not match text which spans lines.  While
\\[font-lock-fontify-buffer] handles multi-line patterns correctly, updating
when you edit the buffer does not, since it considers text one line at a time.

(autoload 'hexl-mode "hexl" "\
\\<hexl-mode-map>
A major mode for editing binary files in hex dump format.

This function automatically converts a buffer into the hexl format
using the function `hexlify-buffer'.

Each line in the buffer has an \"address\" (displayed in hexadecimal)
representing the offset into the file that the characters on this line
are at and 16 characters from the file (displayed as hexadecimal
values grouped every 16 bits) and as their ASCII values.

If any of the characters (displayed as ASCII characters) are
unprintable (control or meta characters) they will be replaced as
periods.

If `hexl-mode' is invoked with an argument the buffer is assumed to be
in hexl format.

A sample format:

  HEX ADDR: 0001 0203 0405 0607 0809 0a0b 0c0d 0e0f     ASCII-TEXT
  --------  ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----  ----------------

Movement is as simple as movement in a normal emacs text buffer.  Most
cursor movement bindings are the same (ie. Use \\[hexl-backward-char], \\[hexl-forward-char], \\[hexl-next-line], and \\[hexl-previous-line]
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up).

Advanced cursor movement commands (ala \\[hexl-beginning-of-line], \\[hexl-end-of-line], \\[hexl-beginning-of-buffer], and \\[hexl-end-of-buffer]) are
also supported.

There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:

ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.

\\[hexl-quoted-insert] followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.

\\[hexl-insert-hex-char] will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-octal-char] will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-insert-decimal-char] will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.

\\[hexl-mode-exit] will exit hexl-mode.

Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.

You can use \\[hexl-find-file] to visit a file in hexl-mode.

DICTIONARY-NAME is a possible value of variable `ispell-dictionary', nil
means the default dictionary.

CASECHARS is a regular expression of valid characters that comprise a
word.

NOT-CASECHARS is the opposite regexp of CASECHARS.

OTHERCHARS is a regular expression of other characters that are valid
in word constructs.  Otherchars cannot be adjacent to each other in a
word, nor can they begin or end a word.  This implies we can't check
\"Stevens'\" as a correct possessive and other correct formations.

Hint: regexp syntax requires the hyphen to be declared first here.

MANY-OTHERCHARS-P is non-nil if many otherchars are to be allowed in a
word instead of only one.

ISPELL-ARGS is a list of additional arguments passed to the ispell
subprocess.

EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE should be used when dictionaries are used which
have been configured in an Ispell affix file.  (For example, umlauts
can be encoded as \\\"a, a\\\", \"a, ...)  Defaults are ~tex and ~nroff
in English.  This has the same effect as the command-line `-T' option.
The buffer Major Mode controls Ispell's parsing in tex or nroff mode,
but the dictionary can control the extended character mode.
Both defaults can be overruled in a buffer-local fashion. See
`ispell-parsing-keyword' for details on this.

Note that the CASECHARS and OTHERCHARS slots of the alist should
contain the same character set as casechars and otherchars in the
language.aff file (e.g., english.aff).")

MIME minor mode for editing the tagged MIME message.

In this mode, basically, the message is composed in the tagged MIME
format. The message tag looks like:

	--[[text/plain; charset=ISO-2022-JP][7bit]]

The tag specifies the MIME content type, subtype, optional parameters
and transfer encoding of the message following the tag. Messages
without any tag are treated as `text/plain' by default. Charset and
transfer encoding are automatically defined unless explicitly
specified. Binary messages such as audio and image are usually hidden.
The messages in the tagged MIME format are automatically translated
into a MIME compliant message when exiting this mode.

Available charsets depend on Emacs version being used. The following
lists the available charsets of each emacs.

EMACS 18:	US-ASCII is only available.
NEmacs:		US-ASCII and ISO-2022-JP are available.
EMACS 19:	US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1 (or other charset) are available.
XEmacs 19:	US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1 (or other charset) are available.
Mule:		US-ASCII, ISO-8859-* (except for ISO-8859-5), KOI8-R,
		ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-JP-2, ISO-2022-KR, BIG5 and
		ISO-2022-INT-1 are available.

ISO-2022-JP-2 and ISO-2022-INT-1 charsets used in mule is expected to
be used to represent multilingual text in intermixed manner. Any
languages that has no registered charset are represented as either
ISO-2022-JP-2 or ISO-2022-INT-1 in mule.

If you want to use non-ISO-8859-1 charset in EMACS 19 or XEmacs 19,
please set variable `default-mime-charset'. This variable must be
symbol of which name is a MIME charset.

If you want to add more charsets in mule, please set variable
`charsets-mime-charset-alist'. This variable must be alist of which
key is list of leading-char/charset and value is symbol of MIME
charset. (leading-char is a term of MULE 1.* and 2.*. charset is a
term of XEmacs/mule, mule merged EMACS and MULE 3.*) If name of
coding-system is different as MIME charset, please set variable
`mime-charset-coding-system-alist'. This variable must be alist of
which key is MIME charset and value is coding-system.

The syntax of `defadvice' is as follows:

  (defadvice FUNCTION (CLASS NAME [POSITION] [ARGLIST] FLAG...)
    [DOCSTRING] [INTERACTIVE-FORM]

FUNCTION ::= Name of the function to be advised.
CLASS ::= `before' | `around' | `after' | `activation' | `deactivation'.
NAME ::= Non-nil symbol that names this piece of advice.
POSITION ::= `first' | `last' | NUMBER. Optional, defaults to `first',
    see also `ad-add-advice'.
ARGLIST ::= An optional argument list to be used for the advised function
    instead of the argument list of the original.  The first one found in
    before/around/after-advices will be used.
FLAG ::= `protect'|`disable'|`activate'|`compile'|`preactivate'|`freeze'.
    All flags can be specified with unambiguous initial substrings.
DOCSTRING ::= Optional documentation for this piece of advice.
INTERACTIVE-FORM ::= Optional interactive form to be used for the advised
    function.  The first one found in before/around/after-advices will be used.
BODY ::= Any s-expression.

Semantics of the various flags:
`protect': The piece of advice will be protected against non-local exits in
any code that precedes it.  If any around-advice of a function is protected
then automatically all around-advices will be protected (the complete onion).

`activate': All advice of FUNCTION will be activated immediately if
FUNCTION has been properly defined prior to this application of `defadvice'.

`compile': In conjunction with `activate' specifies that the resulting
advised function should be compiled.

`disable': The defined advice will be disabled, hence, it will not be used 
during activation until somebody enables it.

`preactivate': Preactivates the advised FUNCTION at macro-expansion/compile
time.  This generates a compiled advised definition according to the current
advice state that will be used during activation if appropriate.  Only use
this if the `defadvice' gets actually compiled.

`freeze': Expands the `defadvice' into a redefining `defun/defmacro' according
to this particular single advice.  No other advice information will be saved.
Frozen advices cannot be undone, they behave like a hard redefinition of
the advised function.  `freeze' implies `activate' and `preactivate'.  The
documentation of the advised function can be dumped onto the `DOC' file
during preloading.

If optional arg DEFAULT is provided, then it is a string to insert as

If running under X, the keyboard will be grabbed (with XGrabKeyboard())
to reduce the possibility that evesdropping is occuring.

When reading a password, all keys self-insert, except for:
\\<read-passwd-map>
	\\[read-passwd-erase-line]	Erase the entire line.
	\\[quoted-insert]	Insert the next character literally.
	\\[delete-backward-char]	Delete the previous character.
	\\[exit-minibuffer]	Accept what you have typed.
	\\[keyboard-quit]	Abort the command.

The returned value is always a newly-created string.  No additional copies
of the password remain after this function has returned.

NOTE: unless great care is taken, the typed password will exist in plaintext
form in the running image for an arbitrarily long time.  Priveleged users may
be able to extract it from memory.  If emacs crashes, it may appear in the
resultant core file.

Some steps you can take to prevent the password from being copied around:

 - as soon as you are done with the returned string, destroy it with
   (fillarray string 0).  The same goes for any default passwords
   or password histories.

 - do not copy the string, as with concat or substring - if you do, be
   sure to keep track of and destroy all copies.

 - do not insert the password into a buffer - if you do, be sure to 
   overwrite the buffer text before killing it, as with the functions 
   `passwd-erase-buffer' or `passwd-kill-buffer'.  Note that deleting
   the text from the buffer does NOT necessarily remove the text from
   memory.

 - be careful of the undo history - if you insert the password into a 
   buffer which has undo recording turned on, the password will be 
   copied onto the undo list, and thus recoverable.

 - do not pass it as an argument to a shell command - anyone will be
   able to see it if they run `ps' at the right time.

Note that the password will be temporarily recoverable with the `view-lossage'
command.  This data will not be overwritten until another hundred or so 
characters are typed.  There's not currently a way around this." nil nil)

        Currently just prepend the name with the string \"Toggle \".

nil: An ordinary menu item.

   :selected SELECTED

SELECTED is an expression; the checkbox or radio button is selected
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.
Currently just disable radio buttons, no effect on checkboxes.

A menu item can be a string.  Then that string appears in the menu as
unselectable text.  A string consisting solely of hyphens is displayed
as a solid horizontal line.

A menu item can be a list.  It is treated as a submenu.
The first element should be the submenu name.  That's used as the
menu item in the top-level menu.  The cdr of the submenu list
is a list of menu items, as above." nil 'macro)
