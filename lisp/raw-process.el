;; This is a front-end to the make-docfile program that gathers up all the
;; lisp files that will be dumped with XEmacs.  It would probably be best
;; to just move make-docfile.c completely to lisp and be done with it.

(require 'custom)
(load "process")
;; need for stuff called from C by process code
(if (featurep 'windows-nt) (load "win32-native"))
