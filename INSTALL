BUILDING AND INSTALLATION FOR UNIX AND CYGWIN

(for Microsoft Windows, see nt/README also.)

PREREQUISITES
=============

Make sure your system has enough swapping space allocated to handle a
program whose pure code is 900k bytes and whose data area is at least
400k and can reach 8Mb or more.  Note that a typical XEmacs process
can get much bigger: the instance this sentence was written with is
over 100MB!  If the swapping space is insufficient, you will get an
error in the command `temacs -batch -l loadup dump', found in
`./src/Makefile.in.in', or possibly when running the final dumped
XEmacs.

Verify that your users have a high enough stack limit. On some systems
such as OpenBSD and OSF/Tru64 the default is 2MB which is too low.  On
MacOS/X (Darwin), it's 512kB.  See 'PROBLEMS' for details.

Building XEmacs requires about 100 Mb of disk space (including the
XEmacs sources).  Once installed, XEmacs occupies between 20 and 100
MB in the file system where it is installed; this includes the
executable files, Lisp libraries, miscellaneous data files, and
on-line documentation. The exact amount depends greatly on the number
of extra Lisp packages that are installed.

XEmacs requires an ANSI C compiler, such as GCC.  If you wish to build
the documentation yourself, you will need at least version 1.68 of
makeinfo (GNU texinfo-3.11).  GNU Texinfo 4.2 is recommended; it is
necessary for building Lisp packages, and we may move to it for the core.

A note on terminology: unfortunately the terms "library" and "package"
are heavily overloaded.  In the following, "library" refers to an
external body of executable code which may be linked with XEmacs at
build time to provide support for system features, such as images,
audio, stream compression, databases, and input methods.  A "Lisp
library" is a file of Lisp code which may be loaded into XEmacs at
run-time to provide editor features.  A "package" is a specially
prepared Lisp library or set of Lisp libraries, providing for easy
installation, upgrade, and removal of applications written in Lisp.

PACKAGE SYSTEM
==============

The file README.packages contain information vital to have a fully
working XEmacs.  It includes a description of available packages, and
how to bootstrap XEmacs from a minimal or a complete set of packages.
This information was not included in this file only because it is too
large for this terse INSTALL.  Please read README.packages now!

ADD-ON LIBRARIES
================

Decide which libraries you would like to use with XEmacs, but are not
yet available on your system.  On some systems, Motif and CDE are
optional additions.  On Solaris, the SUNWaudmo package enables native
sound support.  There are also a number of free software applications
that XEmacs can use.  If these are not yet available on your system,
obtain, build and install those external libraries before building
XEmacs.  The libraries XEmacs can use are:

   Xaw3d, XPM, JPEG, compface, PNG, zlib, GNU DBM, Berkeley DB, socks,
   term, NAS, Canna, Kinput2, SJ3, Wnn, PostgreSQL, LDAP.

You can get (most of) them from the XEmacs FTP archive at
<ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux>.  Information about what
each library does is available in the file
<ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/00README.txt>.

Use the `--site-includes' and `--site-libraries' options when building
XEmacs to allow configure to find the external software packages.  For
your convenience these can be set together by using the
`--with-site-prefix' option.  This will set these variables as needed
assuming your libraries are organised as a typical /usr tree.

If you link dynamically with external libraries, usually denoted by
".so" (Unix), ".dll" (Windows), or ".dylib" (MacOS) file extensions,
on some systems you may also need to add the library directories to
the `--site-runtime-libraries' option.  It is typically necessary only
if you link with dynamic libraries that are installed in non-standard
directories, or if you expect some of the libraries used to build
XEmacs to be in a different directory at run time than at build time.

NOTE: This option has unusual semantics.  ONLY libraries found in the
directories specified in this option will be used at runtime.  This
means you must specify ALL directories you want searched at runtime in
this option (perhaps excluding a very small number of standard system
library paths).

Directories specified with `--site-libraries' are NOT automatically
added.  The rationale is that most users will not need this option,
and this allows the builder to specify exactly the needed directories.
Specifying unnecessary directories leads to obscure problems
(typically startup delays) if those directories are mounted over a
network, and the automounter configuration changes.  Not all systems
need this option; it's best to avoid using it if you can.

Dynamic linking has pros and cons.  Dynamically linking 3rd party
libraries to XEmacs decreases the size of the binary, and means you
don't need to rebuild XEmacs to take advantage of improvements in the
libraries.  On the other hand, XEmacs can fail subtly if the semantics
of a library changes, other users may not be able to use your
"private" copies of the libraries, and you may have to relink XEmacs,
or even omit the feature, if the ABI changes when the libraries are
upgraded.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
=====================

In the top level directory of the XEmacs distribution, run the
program `configure' as follows:

    ./configure [CONFIGURATION-NAME] [--OPTION[=VALUE]] ...

Controlling the Host Type
-------------------------

Almost always, you should let `configure' (actually the shell script
`config.guess') guess your host type, by omitting the
CONFIGURATION-NAME argument.  If you like to experiment, specify a
configuration name in the form MACHINE-VENDOR-OPSYS, for example:

sparc-sun-solaris2.6

See config.guess and configure.in for valid values for MACHINE,
VENDOR, and OPSYS.  Also check `./etc/MACHINES' for advice on building
on particular machines.

Specifying Location of Headers and Libraries
--------------------------------------------

The `--site-includes=DIR' and `--site-libraries=DIR' options allow you
to specify additional places the compiler should look for include
files and object libraries.  You may specify multiple DIR's by
enclosing the list in quotes.  All the external libraries you want to
use with XEmacs (e.g. xpm, wnn, ...) described later should have their
include and library directories defined using these options.

The `--site-runtime-libraries=DIR' option specifies directories to
search for shared libraries at run time.  If you use this option, you
must specify ALL of the directories containing shared libraries at run
time, including system directories.  Please read the information about
"ADD-ON LIBRARIES" above very carefully.

The `--x-includes=DIR' and `--x-libraries=DIR' options tell the build
process where the compiler should look for the include files and
object libraries used with the X Window System.  Normally, `configure'
is able to find them; these options are necessary if you have your X
Window System files installed in unusual places.

Configuring the Build Process
-----------------------------

The `--with-gcc=PROGRAM' option specifies that the build process
should compile XEmacs using GCC.  The `--compiler' option allows you
to specify some other compiler to be used to compile XEmacs.  If
neither option is specified, the environment variable CC is used
instead.  Otherwise the compiler will then default to 'cc'.

The `--xemacs-compiler=PROGRAM' option specifies the compiler control
program for the xemacs binary only.  Other C code will be compiled
according to the `--with-gcc' and `--compiler' options above.  This is
useful if you wish to compile XEmacs with a C++ compiler, because the
utilities in ./lib-src cannot be compiled as C++.  This option is
primarily intended for use by the maintainers.

The `--cflags=FLAGS' option specifies all of the CFLAGS the build process
should use when compiling XEmacs, except for flags controlling warning
generation.  Otherwise the value of the environment variable CFLAGS is
consulted.  If that is also undefined, CFLAGS defaults to "-g -O" for
gcc and "-g" for all other compilers.

The `--cflags_warning=FLAGS' option specifies the warnings to be
generated.  There is normally no reason to use this flag, as XEmacs
turns on as many warnings as possible, and is still expected to build
with no, or at most a few warnings.

The `--dynamic' option specifies that configure should try to link
emacs dynamically rather than statically.

You can build XEmacs for several different machine types from a single
source directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  Create separate
build directories for the different configuration types, and in each
one, run the XEmacs `configure' script.  `configure' looks for the
Emacs source code in the directory that `configure' is in.  The
`--srcdir' option may not work correctly (traditionally it was
overridden by the directory containing `configure').

Configuring the Installation Layout
-----------------------------------

The `--prefix=PREFIXDIR' option specifies where the installation process
should put XEmacs and its data files.  This defaults to `/usr/local'.
- XEmacs (and the other utilities users run) go in PREFIXDIR/bin
  (unless the `--exec-prefix' option says otherwise).
- The architecture-independent files go in PREFIXDIR/lib/xemacs-VERSION
  (where VERSION is the version number of XEmacs, like `21.0').
- The architecture-dependent files go in
  PREFIXDIR/lib/xemacs-VERSION/CONFIGURATION-NAME
  (where CONFIGURATION-NAME is the host type, like mips-dec-ultrix4.2),
  unless the `--exec-prefix' option says otherwise.

The `--exec-prefix=EXECDIR' option allows you to specify a separate
portion of the directory tree for installing architecture-specific
files, like executables and utility programs.  If specified,
- XEmacs (and the other utilities users run) go in EXECDIR/bin, and
- The architecture-dependent files go in
  EXECDIR/lib/xemacs-VERSION/CONFIGURATION-NAME.
EXECDIR/bin should be a directory that is normally in users' PATHs.

If you specify --prefix (or any of the other installation directory
options), they will get compiled into the xemacs executable so it will
be able to find its various associated files.  However, XEmacs has
quite elaborate logic to find out the locations of these directories
dynamically.  Sometimes, it is desirable *not* to compile these
directories into the executable so you can move the XEmacs
installation around (as whole) at will.  This is true for binary kits,
for instance.  Therefore, you can specify --without-prefix on the
configure command line to prevent the installation prefix to become
part of the generated executable; everything else will continue to
work as usual.

Configuring Feature Support
---------------------------

If you don't want X Window System support, specify `--without-x'.  If
you omit this option, `configure' will try to autodetect whether your
system has X Window System support, and arrange to use it if present.

The `--without-xmu' option can be used if your vendor doesn't ship
the Xmu library.

The `--with-menubars=TYPE' option allows you to specify which X
toolkit you wish to use for the menubar.  The valid options are
`lucid', `motif' and `no'.  The default is `lucid' which is a
Motif-lookalike menubar.  We highly recommend its usage over the real
Motif menubar. (In fact, the Motif menubar is currently broken.)  If
`no' is specified then support for menubars will not be compiled in.

The `--with-scrollbars=TYPE' option allows you to specify which X
toolkit you wish to use for the scrollbars.  The valid options are
`lucid', `motif', `athena', `athena3d', and `no'.  The default is
`lucid' which is a Motif-lookalike scrollbar.  If `no' is specified
then support for scrollbars will not be compiled in.

The `--with-dialogs=TYPE' option allows you to specify which X toolkit
you wish to use for the dialog boxes.  The valid options are `athena',
`athena3d', `motif, and `no.  The `lucid' option is accepted and will
result in the `athena' toolkit being used.  If the Motif toolkit can be
found the default is `motif'.  Otherwise, the default is `athena'.  If
`no' is specified then support for dialog boxes will not be compiled
in.

The `--with-toolbars' option allows you to enable or disable toolbar
support.  The default is `yes' if support for a windowing system is
included.

The `--with-xpm' option specifies that XEmacs should support X11
Pixmaps.  `configure' will attempt to detect if you have the Xpm
libraries and define `--with-xpm' for you.

The `--with-xface' option specifies that XEmacs should support
X-Faces.  `configure' will attempt to detect if you have the compface
library and define `--with-xface' for you.

The `--with-database' option specifies that XEmacs should be built
with simple database support.  The valid options are `no' or a
comma-separated list of one or more of `dbm', `gnudbm' or `berkdb'.
`configure' will attempt to detect the necessary libraries and header
files and define `--with-database' for you.

The `--with-postgresql' option specifies that XEmacs should be built
with PostgreSQL support, linking with libpq.  `configure' will attempt
to detect whether PostgreSQL support is available, and automatically
define `--with-postgresql' for you.

The `--with-ldap' option specifies that XEmacs should be build with
LDAP support, using the OpenLDAP libraries.  `configure' will attempt
to detect whether LDAP support is available, and automatically define
`--with-ldap' for you.

The `--with-socks' option specifies that XEmacs should be built with
SOCKS support.  This requires the libsocks library.

The `--external-widget' option specifies that XEmacs should be built
with support for being used as a widget by other X11 applications.
This functionality should be considered beta.

The `--with-sound=TYPE' option specifies that XEmacs should be built
with sound support.  Native (`--with-sound=native') sound support is
currently available only on Sun SparcStations, SGI's, HP9000s, and
systems (such as Linux) with soundcard.h.  Network Audio Support (NAS)
(`--with-sound=nas' or `--with-sound=both') is an extension to X that
you may or may not have for your system.  For NAS, you will probably
need to provide the paths to the nas include and library directories
to configure.  If `--with-sound' is not specified, `configure' will
attempt to determine if your configuration supports native sound and
define --with-sound for you.  If your native sound library is not in a
standard location you can specify it with the `--native-sound-lib=LIB'
flag.  For Linux, `/dev/audio' is required for SunAudio files and
`/dev/dsp' is required for raw data and WAVE format files.

The `--with-tooltalk' option specifies that XEmacs should be built
with ToolTalk support for interconnecting with other applications.
ToolTalk is not yet supported on all architectures.  If you use this
option, you should have the tooltalk package (see etc/PACKAGES)
installed prior to building XEmacs.

The `--with-sparcworks' option specifies that XEmacs should be built
with support for Sun Sparcworks 3.0.1 and up (including Sun WorkShop).
This functionality is only of use on SunOS 4.1.x and Solaris 2.x
systems.  If you use this option, you should have the Sun package (see
etc/PACKAGES) installed prior to building XEmacs.

The `--with-cde' option allows you to enable or disable CDE drag and
drop support.  `configure' will attempt to detect this option and
define `--with-cde' for you.

The `--with-offix' option allows you to enable or disable OffiX drag
and drop support.  This requires no external library support, so if
X11 support is available, then this option defaults to `yes'.  OffiX
support can be explicitly disabled via the `--with-offix=no' option.

Internationalization Options
----------------------------

The `--with-mule' option enables MUlti-Lingual Emacs (Mule) support,
needed to support non-Latin-1 (including Asian) languages.  Mule
support is required for Asian language and Unicode (multibyte and wide
character) support.  With the advent of the Euro and European
Community expansion, Mule support is also recommended for Western
Europeans.  Enabling Mule support requires the mule-base package
installed prior to building XEmacs.  The `--with-xim', --with-xfs',
`--with-canna', `--with-wnn' and `--with-wnn6' options require
Mule support.

The `--with-xim' option enables use of the X11 XIM mechanism to allow
an input method to input text into XEmacs.  The input method is shared
among all the X applications sharing an X display and using the same
language.  The XIM support comes in two flavors: `motif' and `xlib'.
The Motif support (the XmIm* functions) is preferred when available.
The xlib XIM support works reasonably well so long as the X11 libraries
are recent enough.  It has been fairly well tested on Linux with glibc
2.0.5 and 2.0.6 and Kinput2 as an XIM server.  In this configuration
X11 must be recompiled with X_LOCALE defined because glibc is lacking
localization for Japanese.  The XIM support defaults to `no' except
when Motif is detected where it is stable with OSF libraries.  The XIM
support in Lesstif (a Free Motif replacement) does not work as of
v0.82.  If you enable this option, you will probably wish to install
the `locale' package which contains localized Splash screens and
Menubars.

The `--with-xfs' option enables use of a multilingual Menubar.  At the
present time, only Japanese and French locales are supported.  In
order to use a multilingual Menubar you must have the `locale' package
installed.  The `locale' package does not have to be installed when
building XEmacs.

The `--with-canna' option enables the use of the Canna Japanese input
method.  This is stable code and fairly well tested.  In order to use
it, you will have to have the Canna server installed and running.
Canna versions 3.2pl2 and 3.5b2 are known to work.  Version 3.2pl2 is
considered most stable than version 3.5b2.  If Canna is already
installed, configure will autodetect it, so you never need to
explicitly use this option unless your Canna libraries are somewhere
strange.  Canna run time support is currently bundled with the
`mule-base' package so there is nothing additional to install in order
to use it.

The `--with-wnn' and `--with-wnn6' options are for compiling with the Wnn
multi-language input method.  `--with-wnn' is for compiling with Wnn-4.2,
the Free version of WNN.  `--with-wnn6' is for compiling against WNN6,
the commercial version of WNN available from OMRON Corporation.  This is
stable code and fairly well tested.  In order to build with this
option, you will need to have the `egg-its' lisp package already
installed.

Please note that it is safe to build with as many of the options
`--with-xim', `--with-canna' and `--with-wnn' as your system
supports.

Options for Developers and Special Requirements
-----------------------------------------------

The `--rel-alloc' option can be used to either enable or disable use
of the relocating allocator.  Turning on --rel-alloc will allow XEmacs
to return unused memory to the operating system, thereby reducing its
memory footprint.  However, it may make XEmacs runs more slowly,
especially if your system's `mmap' implementation is missing or
inefficient.  Generally, it's best to go with the default
configuration for your system.  You can tweak this based on how you
use XEmacs, and the memory and cpu resources available on your system.

The `--with-system-malloc' option can be used to either enable or
disable use of the system malloc.  Generally, it's best to go with the
default configuration for your system.  Note that on many systems
using the system malloc disables the use of the relocating allocator.

The `--with-debug-malloc' option can be used to link a special
debugging version of malloc.  Debug Malloc is not included with XEmacs
and is intended for use only by the developers. It may be obtained
from <URL:http://www.letters.com/dmalloc/>.

The `--debug' and `--error-checking' options are primarily useful to
the developers.  `--debug' incorporates code for performing various
tests, but does not impose a speed penalty.  `--error-checking' adds
additional tests to many of the commonly used macros, and imposes a
speed penalty.  Using either or both of these options can make bug
reports more useful to the developers.

The `--verbose' and `--extra-verbose' options are useful only to the
developers.  `--verbose' causes the results of all configure tests to
be displayed.  `--extra-verbose' displays additional information,
useful for debugging `configure'.

MAIL LOCKING
============

For most platforms, configure or the src/s file have the preferred
method for locking mail spool files preconfigured.  Otherwise you must
find out for youself.  Do not choose a locking protocol "on the
objective merits."  XEmacs must use the same method as other mail
utilities on your system, or you WILL lose mail.

Presently, XEmacs supports lockf, flock, and dot locking.  Specify the
locking method via the --mail-locking=METHOD option to configure.
Valid values for METHOD are --mail-locking are `lockf', `flock', and
`dot'.

RUNNING CONFIGURE
=================

`configure' doesn't do any compilation or installation itself.  It
just creates the files that influence those things: `./src/config.h',
and all the Makefiles in the build tree.

When it is done, `configure' prints a description of what it did and
creates a shell script `config.status' which, when run, recreates the
same configuration.  If `configure' exits with an error after
disturbing the status quo, it removes `config.status'.  If `configure'
doesn't work as expected, the file `config.log' contains details of
the tests run and their results.

AUXILIARY PATHS
===============

Look at `./lisp/paths.el'; if some of those values are not right for
your system, set up the file `./lisp/site-init.el' with XEmacs Lisp
code to override them; it is not a good idea to edit paths.el itself.
YOU MUST USE THE LISP FUNCTION `setq' TO ASSIGN VALUES, rather than
`defvar', as used by `./lisp/paths.el'.  For example,

     (setq news-inews-program "/usr/bin/inews")

is how you would override the default value of the variable
news-inews-program (which is "/usr/local/inews").

Before you override a variable this way, *look at the value* that the
variable gets by default!  Make sure you know what kind of value the
variable should have.  If you don't pay attention to what you are
doing, you'll make a mistake.

Things may malfunction if the variable `directory-abbrev-alist' is not
set up to translate "temporary" automounter mount points into the
canonical form.  XEmacs tries to detect how your automounter is
configured.  If you have an unusual automounter configuration that
XEmacs cannot detect, you may need to change the value of
`directory-abbrev-alist'.

SITE-SPECIFIC STARTUP CODE
==========================

Put into `./lisp/site-init.el' or `./lisp/site-load.el' any Emacs Lisp
code you want XEmacs to load before it is dumped out.  Use
site-load.el for additional libraries if you arrange for their
documentation strings to be in the lib-src/DOC file (see
src/Makefile.in.in if you wish to figure out how to do that).  For all
else, use site-init.el.

Note that, on some systems, the code you place in site-init.el must
not use expand-file-name or any other function which may look
something up in the system's password and user information database.
See `./PROBLEMS' for more details on which systems this affects.

The `site-*.el' files are nonexistent in the distribution.  You do not
need to create them if you have nothing to put in them.

TERMCAP CONFIGURATION
=====================

Refer to the file `./etc/TERMS' for information on fields you may
wish to add to various termcap entries.  The files `./etc/termcap.ucb'
and `./etc/termcap.dat' may already contain appropriately-modified
entries.

RUNNING MAKE
============

Run `make' in the top directory of the XEmacs distribution to finish
building XEmacs in the standard way.  The final executable file is
named `src/xemacs'.  You can execute this file in place without
copying it, if you wish; then it automatically uses the sibling
directories ../lisp, ../lib-src, ../info.

Or you can install the executable and the other XEmacs into their
permanent locations, with `make install'.  By default, XEmacs's files
are installed in the following directories:

`/usr/local/bin' holds the executable programs users normally run -
		`xemacs', `etags', `ctags', `b2m', `emacsclient', `ellcc',
		`gnuclient', `gnudoit', `gnuattach', and `rcs-checkin'.

`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/lisp' holds the Emacs Lisp libraries;
		`VERSION' stands for the number of the XEmacs version
		you are installing, like `18.59' or `19.14'.  Since
		the lisp libraries change from one version of XEmacs to
		another, including the version number in the path
		allows you to have several versions of XEmacs installed
		at the same time; this means that you don't have to
		make XEmacs unavailable while installing a new version.

		XEmacs searches for its lisp files in these
		directories, and then in
		`/usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp/*'.

`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/etc' holds the XEmacs tutorial, the
		`yow' database, and other architecture-independent
		files XEmacs might need while running.  VERSION is as
		specified for `.../lisp'.

`/usr/local/lib/xemacs/lock' contains files indicating who is
		editing what, so XEmacs can detect editing clashes
		between users.

`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/CONFIGURATION-NAME' contains executable
		programs used by XEmacs that users are not expected to
		run themselves, and the DOC file. `VERSION' is the
		number of the XEmacs version you are installing, and
		`CONFIGURATION-NAME' is the host type of your system.
		Since these files are specific to the version of
		XEmacs, operating system, and architecture in use,
		including the configuration name in the path allows
		you to have several versions of XEmacs for any mix of
		machines and operating systems installed at the same
		time; this is useful for sites at which different
		kinds of machines share the file system XEmacs is
		installed on.

`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/CONFIGURATION-NAME/modules' holds the Emacs
		dynamically loadable modules.  These are special programs
		typically written in C that can be loaded in much the same
		way that Lisp packages are.  Not all systems support
		dynamic modules, so do not be alarmed if this directory
		does not exist or is empty.

		XEmacs searches for modules in this directory, or any
		sub-directory of it, and then in
		`/usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-modules/*'.

`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/info' holds the on-line documentation
		for XEmacs, known as "info files".

`/usr/local/man/man1' holds the man pages for the programs installed
		in `/usr/local/bin'.

If these directories are not what you want, you can specify where to
install XEmacs's libraries and data files or where XEmacs should search
for its lisp files by giving values for `make' variables as part of
the command.

You can change where the build process installs XEmacs and its data
files by specifying values for `make' variables as part of the `make'
command line.  For example, if you type

    make install bindir=/usr/local/gnubin

the `bindir=/usr/local/gnubin' argument indicates that the XEmacs
executable files should go in `/usr/local/gnubin', not
`/usr/local/bin'.

Here is a complete list of the variables you may want to set.

`bindir' indicates where to put executable programs that users can
	run.  This defaults to /usr/local/bin.

`datadir' indicates where to put the architecture-independent
	read-only data files that XEmacs refers to while it runs; it
	defaults to /usr/local/lib.  We create the following
	subdirectories under `datadir':
	- `xemacs-VERSION/lisp', containing the XEmacs lisp libraries, and

	- `xemacs-VERSION/etc', containing the XEmacs tutorial and the
		`yow' database.
	`VERSION' is the number of the XEmacs version you are installing,
	like `18.59' or `19.14'.  Since these files vary from one version
	of XEmacs to another, including the version number in the path
	allows you to have several versions of XEmacs installed at the
	same time; this means that you don't have to make XEmacs
	unavailable while installing a new version.

`statedir' indicates where to put architecture-independent data files
	that XEmacs modifies while it runs; it defaults to
	/usr/local/lib as well.  We create the following
	subdirectories under `statedir':
	- `xemacs/lock', containing files indicating who is editing
		what, so XEmacs can detect editing clashes between
		users.

`libdir' indicates where to put architecture-specific data files that
	XEmacs refers to as it runs; it too defaults to `/usr/local/lib'.
	We create the following subdirectories under `libdir':
	- `xemacs-VERSION/CONFIGURATION-NAME', containing executable
		programs used by XEmacs that users are not expected to run
		themselves, and the DOC file.
	`VERSION' is the number of the XEmacs version you are installing,
	and `CONFIGURATION-NAME' is the host type of your system.
	Since these files are specific to the version of XEmacs,
	operating system, and architecture in use, including the
	configuration name in the path allows you to have several
	versions of XEmacs for any mix of machines and operating
	systems installed at the same time; this is useful for sites
	at which different kinds of machines share the file system
	XEmacs is installed on.

`infodir' indicates where to put the info files distributed with
	XEmacs; it defaults to `/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/info'.

`mandir' indicates where to put the man pages for XEmacs and its
	utilities (like `etags'); it defaults to
	`/usr/local/man/man1'.

`prefix' doesn't give a path for any specific part of XEmacs; instead,
	its value is used to determine the defaults for all the
	architecture-independent path variables - `datadir',
	`statedir', `infodir', and `mandir'.  Its default value is
	`/usr/local'; the other variables add on `lib' or `man' to it
	by default.

	For example, suppose your site generally places GNU software
	under `/usr/users/software/gnusoft' instead of `/usr/local'.
	By including
	    `prefix=/usr/users/software/gnusoft'
	in the arguments to `make', you can instruct the build process
	to place all of the XEmacs data files in the appropriate
	directories under that path.

`exec_prefix' serves the same purpose as `prefix', but instead
	determines the default values for the architecture-dependent
	path variables - `bindir' and `libdir'.

The above variables serve analogous purposes in the makefiles for all
GNU software; here are some variables specific to XEmacs.

`lispdir' indicates where XEmacs installs and expects its lisp
	libraries.  Its default value, based on `datadir' (see above),
	is `/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/lisp' (where `VERSION' is as
	described above).

`sitelispdir' indicates where XEmacs should search for lisp libraries
	specific to your site. XEmacs checks them in order before
	checking `lispdir'.  Its default value, based on `datadir'
	(see above), is `/usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp'.

`etcdir' indicates where XEmacs should install and expect the rest of
	its architecture-independent data, like the tutorial and yow
	database.  Its default value, based on `datadir'
	(see above), is `/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/etc' (where
	`VERSION' is as described above).

`lockdir' indicates the directory where XEmacs keeps track of its
	locking information.  Its default value, based on `statedir'
	(see above), is `/usr/local/lib/xemacs/lock'.

`archlibdir' indicates where XEmacs installs and expects the
	executable files and other architecture-dependent data it uses
	while running.  Its default value, based on `libdir' (see
	above), is `/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/CONFIGURATION-NAME'
	(where VERSION and CONFIGURATION-NAME are as described above).

`docdir' indicates where to put Lisp documentation strings that XEmacs
        refers to as it runs.  It defaults to the value of `archlibdir'
        (see above).

`moduledir' indicates where XEmacs installs and expects to find
	any dynamic modules.  Its default value, based on
	`archlibdir' (see above) is
	`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/CONFIGURATION-NAME/modules'
	(where VERSION and CONFIGURATION-NAME are as described above).
	By their very nature, dynamic loadable modules are architecture-
	dependent, and care should be taken not to set this directory
	to a system- or architecture-independent directory.

Remember that you must specify any variable values you need each time
you run `make' in the top directory.  If you run `make' once to build
xemacs, test it, and then run `make' again to install the files, you
must provide the same variable settings each time.  To make the
settings persist, you can edit them into the `Makefile' in the top
directory, but be aware that running the `configure' program erases
`Makefile' and rebuilds it from `Makefile.in'.

The top-level Makefile stores the variable settings it used in the
Makefiles for the subdirectories, so you don't have to specify them
when running make in the subdirectories.

Using GNU Make allows for simultaneous builds with and without the
--srcdir option.

STRIPPING BINARIES
==================

This saves nothing but a small (by modern standards) amount of disk
space; the symbol table is not loaded into memory at execution time.
If you do encounter a crash or other serious bug, the first thing the
developers will do is ask you to build an XEmacs with a full symbol
table, anyway.  Don't strip the XEmacs binary.

MAIL-LOCKING POST-INSTALLATION
==============================

If your system uses dot-locking to interlock access to mailer inbox
files, then you might need to make the movemail program setuid or
setgid to enable it to write the lock files.  We believe this is safe.
The setuid/setgid bits need not be set on any other XEmacs-related
executables.

CLEANING UP
==========

You are done with the hard part!  You can remove executables and
object files from the build directory by typing `make clean'.  To also
remove the files that `configure' created (so you can compile XEmacs
for a different configuration), type `make distclean'.

READ README.packages
====================

Do it!

PROBLEMS
========

The most common problem is that you forgot to read and follow the
directions in README.packages.  You can not have a normal XEmacs
without downloading some additional packages.

See the file PROBLEMS in this directory for a list of various problems
sometimes encountered, and what to do about them.  PROBLEMS is also
the place where platform-specific build notes can be found.
