NOTE: This version of gnuserv has some enhancements over the original version 
  distributed by Andy Norman. See the end of this file for more details. 
****

To install, copy gnuserv.el into a directory on your GNU Emacs
load-path. Edit Makefile and change INCLUDES to point to the src
directory underneath your emacs source tree (or make yourself a
config.h file in this directory by hand, starting with config.h.proto
as a first cut) and type:

     make

This should compile the server and the two clients. Now put gnuserv,
gnuclient and gnudoit in a directory that users have in their executable
search paths.

This version of gnuserv has been enhanced by a number of people, including
Bob Weiner <weiner@mot.com>, Darrell Kindred <dkindred@cmu.edu>,
Arup Mukherjee <arup@cmu.edu>, and Ben Wing <ben@xemacs.org>. The
modifications are basically as follows:

Bob Weiner: 

     Integrated support for several versions of emacs. New requests
     from gnuclient cause the creation of new frames. Removed the
     restriction on the length of the string passed to gnudoit. Later
     added a server-done-function variable to control what happens to
     a buffer after the user is done with it. Mods to each of the .c
     files as well as gnuserv.el.

Darrell Kindred:

     Removed the restriction on the length of the string returned from
     a gnudoit request, for the purposes of unix/internet sockets.
     Allow the gnudoit request to be read from stdin if it's not
     specified on the command line. Internet sockets are not opened
     unless the GNU_SECURE variable is specified. Unix sockets are
     created in a protected ancestral directory, since many Unix
     variants don't enforce socket permissions properly. An internet
     socket accepting local connections is not opened by default
     because this would make it possibly to override all security on
     the unix socket. See the man page for details. Unless told to do
     otherwise by a command-line argument, gnuclient and gnudoit now
     try to open a unix socket by default if support for them was
     compiled in.  Mods to each of the .c files and to gnuserv.el.

Arup Mukherjee:
     Removed the restriction on the length of the string returned from
     a gnudoit request, for the purposes of sysv ipc. Added support
     for the "gnuserv-frame" variable allowing you to specify control
     whether or not new screens are created in response to each
     gnuclient request. Made a number of other bugfixes and changes to
     the lisp part of the code, allowing gnuserv to work properly with
     newer emacs versions. All the changes are listed in the changelog
     at the beginning of gnuserv.el. Also fixed up the man page to
     reflect the new gnuserv features. On HPs, stopped the "-r"
     parameter (in gnuclient) from defaulting to /net/<remotehost>.
     Not all installations want this, and it's much harder to debug
     when things stop working. Changed the man page to reflect this.
     Mods to each of the .c files, gnuserv.el and gnuserv.1

     More recently - added Xauth(1X11)-style authentication to gnuserv (as 
     of version 2.1). Although the code is completely new, credit is
     due to Richard Caley <rjc@cogsci.edinburgh.ac.uk> ... he wrote a
     prototype implementation from which I borrowed the basic
     mechanism for hooking Xauth into gnuserv. 

Ben Wing:
     Added gnuattach.
