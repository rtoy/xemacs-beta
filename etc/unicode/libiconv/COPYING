The source to libiconv 1.13.1 has both COPYING (GPL v3) and COPYING.LIB
(LGPL v2) in it.  The README has the following to say:

================================ cut ==============================
Copyright
---------

The libiconv and libcharset _libraries_ and their header files are under LGPL,
see file COPYING.LIB.

The iconv _program_ and the documentation are under GPL, see file COPYING.
================================ cut ==============================

The .TXT files that we copied have no copyright info in them, but the
C files in the same directory indicate that they are part of `libiconv'.
As a result I (Ben Wing) assume that the .TXT files are under the LPGL.
