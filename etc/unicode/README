This directory contains Unicode translation tables for most of the
charsets in XEmacs.

The tables in most of the directories are in a standard format that can be
read by the function `load-unicode-mapping-table'.  References to these
files are coded into files in the `lisp' and `lisp/mule' subdiectories of
the source tree, such as `unicode.el' and various writing-system-specific
files (e.g. `mule/latin.el', `mule/cyrillic.el').  The tables in `ibm/' are
not currently in the right format, but could easily be converted by an
appropriate perl or Elisp script.

Sometimes the same character set has more than one table in different
directories.  Sometimes one table is more complete than others, e.g. the
tables for CNS 11643 in `mule-ucs' have mappings for non-BMP (greater than
0xFFFF) Unicode characters, while the ones in `unicode-consortium' don't.
It's possible to use one table to check the accuracy of another, although
we don't currently do that.  We tend to prefer the tables in
`unicode-consortium' over others unless there's a good reason to do
otherwise (e.g. as previously described for CNS 11643).

The tables in unicode-consortium/ come from:

http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/

The tables in ibm/ come from:

http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/charset/

The tables in oreilly/ come from:

http://examples.oreilly.com/cjkvinfo/unicode/

The tables in mule-ucs/ come from the mule-ucs/lisp/reldata directory in
the mule-ucs package, available from the XEmacs download repository under

http://www.xemacs.org/Releases/index.html#Packages

The tables in other/ were generated in various ways described in the
README file in that directory.
