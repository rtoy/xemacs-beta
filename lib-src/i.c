/* When run with an argument, i treats it as a command line, and pipes
command stdin, stdout and stderr to its own respective streams. How
silly it should sound, but windowed program in Win32 cannot do output
to the console from which it has been started, and should be run using
this utility.

This utility is for running [tx]emacs as part of make process so that
its output goes to the same console as the rest of the make output
does.  It can be used also when xemacs should be run as a batch
command ina script, especially when its standart output should be
obtained programmatically. */

      fishy.  I tried commenting out the calls to close the standard
      handles at the bottom of the program, but it made no difference.
