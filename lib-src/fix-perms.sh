### Commentary:

# This program sets the executable bit on all scripts and executable files
# in the XEmacs source tree, including those that are built.

### Code:

# List of executable source files in various directories (root, lib-src, etc)
# other than .sh files.  Note that we are free to list files in
# subdirectories here rather than creating a separate item list"
