/* The d_nameln member of a struct dirent includes the '\0' character
   on some systems, but not on others.  What's worse, you can't tell
   at compile-time which one it will be, since it really depends on
   the sort of system providing the filesystem you're reading from,
   not the system you are running on.  Paul Eggert
   <eggert@bi.twinsun.com> says this occurs when Emacs is running on a
   SunOS 4.1.2 host, reading a directory that is remote-mounted from a
   Solaris 2.1 host and is in a native Solaris 2.1 filesystem.

   (and Solaris 2 doesn't have a d_nameln member at all!  Posix.1
   doesn't specify it -- mrb)

   Since applying strlen to the name always works, we'll just do that.  */
