     1) If the string has no `string-translatable' property or its value

	file, to avoid excessive translation.  (The user can also explicitly
	add this property to a string.)
     2) If the string's `string-translatable' property is a string,
	that string should be returned.  `format' add this property.
	This allows translation to take place at the proper time but
	avoids excessive translation if the string is not destined for
	a translating stream.  (See print_internal().)
     3) If gettext() returns the same string, then Fgettext() should return
        the same object, minus the 'string-translatable' property. */
