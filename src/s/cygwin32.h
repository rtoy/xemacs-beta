/* Building under cygwin
 *
 * The approach I have taken with this port is to use primarily the
 * UNIX code base adding stuff that is MS-Windows specific. This works
 * quite well, and is in keeping with my perception of the cygwin
 * philosophy.  Note that if you make changes to this file you do NOT
 * want to define WIN32_NATIVE (formerly "WINDOWSNT"), I repeat - do
 * not define this, it will break everything horribly. What does get
 * defined is HAVE_MS_WINDOWS, but this is done by configure and only
 * applies to the window system.
 *
 * When building make sure your HOME path is unix style - i.e. without
 * a drive letter.
 *
 * once you have done this, configure and make.
 *
 * windows '95 - I haven't tested this under '95, it will probably
 * build but I konw there are some limitations with cygwin under 95 so
 * YMMV. I build with NT4 SP3.
