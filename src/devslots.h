   because there are numerous places we want to iterate over them, such

   them.

   undefine; that happens automatically. */

     selected_frame but not the frame_with_focus.  However, eventually
     either the two values will be the same, or frame_with_focus will
     be nil: right before waiting for an event, the focus is changed
     to point to the selected_frame if XEmacs currently has the focus
     on this device.  Note that frame_with_focus may be nil (none of the
     frames on this device have the window-system focus), but

     but frame_with_focus_for_hooks is used for running the select-frame-hook
     and deselect-frame-hook.  We do this because we split the focus handling
     into two parts: one part (deals with drawing the solid/box cursor)
     runs as soon as a focus event is received the other (running the
     hooks) runs after any pending sit-for/sleep-for/accept-process-output
     calls are done. */

     is that the window manager may not grant our request to change
     the focus (so we can't just change frame_with_focus), and we don't
     want to keep sending requests again and again to the window manager.
