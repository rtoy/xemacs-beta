 * The redisplay structures used to be stored with each window.  While
 * they are logically something associated with frames they can't be
 * stored there with a redisplay which handles variable height lines.
 * Lines in horizontally split windows might not line up.  So they get
 * stored with the windows.
 *
 * The problem with this is window configurations.  When restoring a
 * window configuration it now becomes problematic to do an
 * incremental redisplay.  The solution is to store the redisplay
 * structures with the frame as they should be but laid out in the
 * same manner as the window structure.  Thus is born the window
 * mirror.
 *
 * It also becomes a convenient place to stick scrollbar instances
 * since they extrapolate out to having the same problem described for
 * the display structures.

/* NOTE: The window-mirror structure formerly was not a Lisp object, and
   marking was handled specially.  I've gotten recurring crashes, however,
   using the mouse wheel under Windows, where either the window mirror
   accessed through a scrollbar instance, or the frame pointed to by that
   window mirror, gets garbaged.  Things are tricky under windows because
   the scrollbar instances are stored in HWND-specific data.  Furthermore,
   we have scrollbar-instance caches to complicate things.  Both of these
   make it very difficult (for me at least, not being intimately familiar
   with the redisplay code) to track exactly when and where a particular
   window mirror or scrollbar instance has pointers to it, or whether a
   window mirror might have a dead frame or buffer in it (i.e. not
   necessarily gc-protected by being on a global list).  By far the safest
   thing, then, is to make both structures Lisp objects and not explicitly
   xfree() them.  This should make no practical difference in memory usage
   because neither structure is created very often (only when windows are
   created or deleted). --ben */

     we end up with a tree of deleted windows which are all connected
     through the `next' slot.  This might not seem so bad, as they're
     deleted, and will presumably be GCed - but if even *one* of those
     windows is still being pointed to, by the user, or by a window
