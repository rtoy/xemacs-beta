/* There have been some arguments over the what the type should be that
   specifies a count of bytes in a data block to be written out or read in,
   using Lstream_read(), Lstream_write(), and related functions.
   Originally it was long, which worked fine; Martin "corrected" these to
   size_t and ssize_t on the grounds that this is theoretically cleaner and
   is in keeping with the C standards.  Unfortunately, this practice is
   horribly error-prone due to design flaws in the way that mixed
   signed/unsigned arithmetic happens.  In fact, by doing this change,
   Martin introduced a subtle but fatal error that caused the operation of
   sending large mail messages to the SMTP server under Windows to fail.
   By putting all values back to be signed, avoiding any signed/unsigned
   mixing, the bug immediately went away.  The type then in use was
   Lstream_Data_Count, so that it be reverted cleanly if a vote came to
   that.  Now it is Bytecount.

   Some earlier comments about why the type must be signed: This MUST BE
   SIGNED, since it also is used in functions that return the number of
   bytes actually read to or written from in an operation, and these
   functions can return -1 to signal error.
   
   Note that the standard Unix read() and write() functions define the
   count going in as a size_t, which is UNSIGNED, and the count going
   out as an ssize_t, which is SIGNED.  This is a horrible design
   flaw.  Not only is it highly likely to lead to logic errors when a
   -1 gets interpreted as a large positive number, but operations are
   bound to fail in all sorts of horrible ways when a number in the
   upper-half of the size_t range is passed in -- this number is
   unrepresentable as an ssize_t, so code that checks to see how many
   bytes are actually written (which is mandatory if you are dealing
   with certain types of devices) will get completely screwed up.

   This is especially the case with complicated streams like
   decoding streams -- the seek pointer in this case can't be a single
   integer but has to be a whole complicated structure that records
   all of the stream's state at the time.

     than one byte that the stream imposes on the returned data, and
     SIZE is less than this granularity. (This will happen frequently
     for streams that need to return whole characters, because
     Lstream_read() calls the reader function repeatedly until it
     has the number of bytes it wants or until 0 is returned.)
     The lstream functions do not treat a 0 return as EOF or do
