     XCheckIfEvent(), looking for keystrokes and button events).  That
     worked in the old cheesoid event loop, which didn't go through
     XtAppDispatchEvent(), but it doesn't work any more -- X events may not
     result in anything.  For example, a button press in a blank part of
     the menubar appears as an X event but will not result in any Emacs
     events (a button press that activates the menubar results in an Emacs
     event through the stop_next_event mechanism).

     into Emacs events is to go ahead and dispatch them until there's

     Quantify results have indicated that in some cases the call to
     detect_input_pending() completely dominates the running time of
     redisplay().  Fortunately, in a SIGIO world we can more quickly
     determine whether there are any X events: if an event has happened
     since the last time we checked, then a SIGIO will have happened.  On a
     machine with broken SIGIO, we'll still be in an OK state --
     quit_check_signal_tick_count will get ticked at least every 1/4
     second, so we'll be no more than that much behind reality. (In general
     it's OK if we erroneously report no input pending when input is
     actually pending() -- preemption is just a bit less efficient, that's
     all.  It's bad bad bad if you err the other way -- you've promised
     that `next-event' won't block but it actually will, and some action
     might get delayed until the next time you hit a key.)
