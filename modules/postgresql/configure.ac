dnl On many Linux systems, PostgreSQL is packaged to be installed in /usr;
dnl in this case, configure will easily detect it there.
dnl
dnl If PostgreSQL is installed into a different prefix,
dnl (such as the default /usr/local/pgsql when building from source),
dnl then specify CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS when configuring.
dnl
dnl Look for these standard header file locations, known to be used on Linux
for header_dir in "" "pgsql/" "postgresql/"; do
